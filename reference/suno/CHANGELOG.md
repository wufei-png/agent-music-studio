## 2026-09-16 - v6 Hands-on Pass

The maintainer ran the v6 setup on their own account before releasing 0.102.0: Advanced Mode, an engineered Style Box at Variety Off, structure tags and Performance Cues, Exclude Styles, Max Mode On. It behaved as the docs describe. This was a sanity pass, not the itemised list below, so the tags come off and community reports stay attributed as reports.

### Changes
- Every **(unverified)** tag removed: `best-practices.md` (Performance Cues row, late-song muffling, group-vocal excludes, Voice upgrade), `structure-tags.md` § Per-Section Direction (bar-count sentence dropped), `models.md` (muffling), `creative-sliders.md` § Max Mode (the muffling-effect and "nobody has combined it with v6-wild" sentences dropped), `100-expert-tips.md` (intro, tips 20, 27, 41, the `Duet` note) `skills/suno-engineer/SKILL.md` (Duration rows; the Narrow Stereo Image fix no longer calls width-prompting unverified) and `skills/mastering-engineer/SKILL.md` (Create-page WAV sample rate).
- Claims that were only ever community reports keep their "reported" wording; nothing was promoted to a plugin-tested fact.
- `migrations/0.102.0.md` no longer carries a verification-status paragraph.
- The 2026-09-09 entry's **Open verification** list is closed. Still not tried on the maintainer's account and still worded as such in the docs: Max Mode and Variety above Off on `v6-wild`; the `v6-mini` "keep one of two" trigger and Free-tier Advanced Mode availability.

---

## 2026-09-12 - Exclude Styles Format

### Changes
- Exclude Styles values are bare elements (`drums`, not `no drums`) everywhere: suno-engineer skill and genre tables, track template, clipboard skill, the voice-tags autotune row; `best-practices.md` § Negative Prompting now states the rule. The `style` clipboard type no longer appends the section to the Style Box (it would have asked for the excluded elements).

---

## 2026-09-12 - Community Tips Guide (#561)

New `100-expert-tips.md`, contributed by @cbrahms in [#561](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/561) (their commits preserved) and aligned with the v6 docs before landing.

### Changes
- Intro now names the contributor and states the precedence rule: `best-practices.md`, `models.md` and `tips-and-tricks.md` win where a tip differs; craft opinions without first-hand confirmation carry **(unverified)**.
- Corrected to match the landed docs: artist names are replaced with a notice (tip 13); Exclude Styles field, not inline "no X" (18); descriptor discipline instead of a 200-character cap (19); duet pattern from `voice-tags.md` (43); Personas → Voices, saved from one song, Max Mode On (53, 63, section VI); slider start at defaults with genre ranges (55); Audio Influence bands from `creative-sliders.md` (57); Variety Off + Max Mode On on Covers (59); Replace Section one-change habit (61); Studio seam caveat (65); Suno's real output loudness and the -14 LUFS / -1.0 dBTP target (79, 85); stems for balance not surgery per #553 (81–83); Sep 3 Terms (95).
- v6 addendum rewritten: three models per `models.md`; Variety rewrites the Style Box (not a batch-diversity knob); Max Mode 2× credits; Simple vs Advanced Mode; Personas are now Voices; Remaster/Cover for older songs; the `Duet`-in-Style-Box claim tagged unverified.
- Tagged **(unverified)**: punctuation parsing (20), chorus-variation melodies (27), capitalised-syllable stress (41).

---

## 2026-09-11 - v6 Follow-up Sweep

Second pass two days after launch: official sources re-checked (all six v6 help articles still dated Sep 9; no new release notes, posts or pricing changes), fifteen post-launch creator videos transcribed and read, four web passes (official, v6, v6-wild, v6-mini). Reddit was unreachable for this pass.

### Changes
- **v6 quality is genre-dependent**: independent testers (including a professional mixer) flag grunge, metal, alt-country and synth-pop vocals as weak while pop, drum & bass and UK garage were praised — added to `models.md` and `best-practices.md`.
- **Narrower stereo image** than testers expected (two independent reports) — noted.
- **Covers**: melody and structure hold with Variety Off and drift with Variety on; Max Mode is the other fix — added to `creative-sliders.md`, `best-practices.md`, `tips-and-tricks.md`.
- **v6-wild**: output length is unpredictable (~50 s to ~7 min observed), not "usually short"; in a seven-genre A/B v6 won fidelity and adherence 7/7 while wild won on character in three genres; the Cover-on-v6 step did not clearly preserve wild's character in one attempt; Exclude Styles confirmed working on wild; Max Mode and Variety on wild untested — `models.md` reworded accordingly.
- **v6-mini**: shares the 8-minute cap; the app's "keep one of two" flow confirmed in strings (trigger unknown); Advanced Mode / Voices / Custom Models on Free reported available by a single source — noted as unconfirmed.
- **Ownership section rewritten** for the Sep 3 Terms (paid-download commercial rights, Remixes never commercial, in-audio watermark, distribution) — it still described the pre-launch WMG plan.
- **Studio**: "regenerate section" garbled vocals for two creators; single-instrument generation no longer adds extra parts — noted in `best-practices.md` § Suno Studio.
- Voices migrated with the wording "converted for v6" — advise a short test before an album run.
- **suno-engineer skill folded in**: the Model row lists the genres where v6 is reported weak (grunge, metal, alt-country, synth-pop, generic rock/soul vocals) as v6-wild first-pass candidates and marks the wild-to-Cover step experimental; the Generate step budgets two or three wild takes; Max Mode on wild flagged untested; four Common Issues entries added (slow/sparse/long output, generic vocal timbre, Cover melody drift, narrow stereo image).
- `creative-sliders.md` troubleshooting: "Cover doesn't resemble the source" now checks Variety Off and Max Mode before Audio Influence. `covers-and-personas.md` carries the same rule in its plan note and Cover checklist.
- `tips-and-tricks.md` § Personas renamed to **Voices** (Suno: "Personas are now Voices"); links in `covers-and-personas.md` updated; the dated December 2025 Persona-dominance notes dropped in both files (undated advice kept).
- `skills/mix-engineer/SKILL.md`: narrow-stereo note — a polish/mastering move, not a prompt fix; check `mono_fold_check` after widening.
- `tips-and-tricks.md` § Replace Section: "one change per edit, with a preserve list" habit (adapted from the closed #564), plus the launch-week Studio regenerate-section caveat.

### Refuted / Not Adopted
- "Non-English output degraded on v6" — one scripted video, no example; not adopted.
- "Variety is just the prompt-enhancement wand" — Suno's FAQ says Variety works "by adjusting and updating your style prompts" and the rewritten text was shown on camera; kept.
- "Max Mode cost unconfirmed" — Suno's own tooltip reads "Costs 2x credits per song"; kept.
- Watermark-removal tools (one video is an advertisement for one) — never cite; Terms forbid.

## 2026-09-10 - v6 Launch Sweep

Suno shipped the v6 family (`v6`, `v6-wild`, `v6-mini`) on 2026-09-09 and retired every earlier model the same day. Sweep sources: Suno's blog, release notes, the six new help articles, the live app's UI strings, both official launch videos, the Billboard CEO interview, 37 press pieces, 14 launch-day video transcripts and ~75 r/SunoAI posts (full dossier on #562). Headline: **prompt syntax and limits unchanged; two new controls (Variety, Max Mode) and the Sep 3 download/ToS regime change the workflow.**

### Features
- **Three models.** v6 (flagship, Pro/Premier), v6-wild (exploration, Pro/Premier; Variety default Off), v6-mini (free tier). Custom Models auto-upgraded to v6; Voices get "Upgrade Voice to v6"; "Personas are now Voices". New `models.md` catalog.
- **Variety** (More Options; default Normal on v6/v6-mini): rewrites and expands the style prompt at any setting above Off — Suno: "reduce the Variety slider to 0" to keep your style tags. Plugin rule: Off for engineered Style Boxes.
- **Max Mode**: "Uses more compute to maximize consistency throughout the song. Costs 2x credits per song." Recommended over two minutes, for covers and Voices.
- Simple Mode gained plain-language edits, lyric swaps, mashups, sample/isolate and image/video/voice-memo inputs; it expands supplied lyrics, so the plugin stays in Advanced Mode.

### Changes
- Docs restructured to cover only the models Suno currently offers: `v5-best-practices.md` and the `version-history/` migration guides removed (git history keeps them); version-agnostic `best-practices.md` opens with "The Current Models"; `models.md` catalog with a "Made before v6" note for older songs, Voices and Custom Models.
- Track template gained `### Generation Settings` (Model, Variety, Max Mode, Vocal Gender, Duration, Weirdness, Style Influence); Cover/Persona block renamed Cover/Voice.
- New advisory pre-generation gate "Generation Settings" (WARN on Variety above Off or an unknown model; note when Max Mode is Off on a ≥2:30 target). `update_track_field` accepts `model`, `variety`, `max-mode`.
- Downloads (since 2026-09-03): Free 7 lifetime, Pro 20/month, Premier 60/month; one song = one download including stems; Studio exports uncapped (32-bit float / 48 kHz). ToS: commercial rights need a paid-plan download; Remixes never commercial; watermark/fingerprint removal prohibited. Believe/TuneCore accept only new-model tracks.
- Artist names: still rewritten ("Artist name '…' replaced"), now with a visible notice.

### Refuted / Not Adopted
- "v6 changed prompt syntax or character limits" — no; Style 1,000 / Lyrics 5,000 / Exclude 1,000 / 8 min all measured unchanged.
- "v6 allows artist names for partner artists" — no.
- "v6 was trained exclusively on licensed music" — Suno says "developed with our industry partners"; executives describe Warner data + user-preference data + R&D; BMG not in the launch model. Attributed, not asserted.
- `V6` / `V6_WILD` / `V6_MINI` API identifiers — do not exist; no official API.
- "Personas were removed" — renamed to Voices; legacy option remains.
- "Duration slider is v5.5-only" — present on v6 (10 s–6:00, default 3:00).
- "v6 has fewer artifacts" as a blanket claim — contested (The Verge, Reddit); genre-dependent.

### Open verification (closed 2026-09-16 — see that entry; the tags are gone)
1. Structure tags and Performance Cues honored on v6 at Variety Off.
2. Variety Off vs Normal on an engineered Style Box.
3. Max Mode vs the reported late-song muffling (~2:30+).
4. Exclude Styles still suppressing group vocals.
5. Which v6 models accept a Voice / Custom Model without the upgrade step.
6. Create-page WAV sample rate / bit depth.
7. Duration Custom vs an overlong lyric.
8. v6-mini vs v6 on a nerdcore and a rock track.
9. Single-lyric swap and a chorus-only edit (Simple Mode) — scope bleed.
10. Bar-count tags `[VERSE 1 8]`.
11. Max Mode on v6-wild; Variety above Off on v6-wild.
12. Structure tags and Exclude Styles parity on v6-wild and v6-mini.
13. Studio "regenerate section" garbled-vocal reports — reproducible?

## 2026-07-07 - V5.5 Mid-Year Research Sweep

Deep multi-source research pass (Suno primary docs + community guides, adversarially fact-checked). Headline: the genuinely new/vetted material since the April V5.5 update is **feature-driven**, not a new prompt grammar. Most third-party "V5.5 prompt-grammar" tips failed verification and were **not adopted** (see Refuted below).

### Features
- **Stem separation overhauled** (June 11, 2026) into three selectable modes: **Auto Split** (the classic 12-category model), **Split from Mix** (pull one instrument/voice out → 2 stems: the target + everything-else), and **Advanced Split** (extract one instrument chosen from ~100; Premier, per-extraction credit cost). Suno describes the new pipeline as regenerating each stem from its model rather than frequency-carving the mix — that's Suno's own claim, not independently verified. See `v5-best-practices.md` § Stem Extraction for the caveat and the bleed/crosstalk/shared-reverb behavior observed in practice (mainly on Auto Split).

### Changes
- **Descriptor-count guidance reframed.** The "4-7 descriptor sweet spot" is a starting heuristic, **not a Suno-official rule** — real style boxes routinely run ~10 focused descriptors. The advisory pre-generation gate now flags only genuine synonym-pile bloat (**>12**, was >7) and no longer mislabels sparse boxes. The failure mode is *duplication*, not count.
- **Negative prompting clarified.** Suno's dedicated **Exclude Styles** field (Custom Mode → Advanced Options, Pro/Premier) is the reliable path; inline `no X` in the main style prompt is a weaker free-tier fallback. Added group-vocal suppression vocabulary (choir, crowd vocals, backing vocals, gang vocals, call-and-response, vocal harmonies, layered vocals). Exclusion is probabilistic — it shifts odds, not a hard filter.
- **Audio Influence × Voices.** When using Voices (voice cloning), keep Audio Influence high (~0.70–0.85) for voice resemblance.
- **Subtle-descriptor claim softened.** "V5.5 honors subtle descriptors more reliably" is engine-reported, not independently verified — reworded from a factual claim to a hedged one.
- **Performance-Cue formatting.** Cues are now written as a short comma-free phrase: `[Outro - chant fading]`, not `[Outro - chant, fading]`. Convention change only — the gate detects cues by the ` - ` separator, so behavior is unchanged.
- **Corrected V5 release date** in the V4→V5 migration guide (was "October 2024"; now "September 2025" to match the repo's own Suno Studio / v5-generation dating).

### Refuted / Not Adopted
Adversarial verification (majority-refute to kill) rejected these widely-circulated claims; do **not** re-add them:
- **"4-7 descriptors is the optimal/required count"** — traces to a single commercial guide; no evidence-based number exists (reframed as a heuristic).
- **Four-layer style template** ending in 2-3 `no` negatives — unsupported.
- **Per-section parameterized tags** like `[Verse: whispered vocals, acoustic only]` — unsupported (this plugin already rejected them as tag soup).
- **Inline `no autotune`/`no reverb` in the style field** as a reliable mechanism — the dedicated Exclude Styles field is the real one.
- **"V5.5 honors subtle production descriptors better than v4.5"** — refuted for lack of evidence (softened, not removed).
- **"V5.5 follows structural metatags more reliably"** — unsupported.

### Documentation
- v5-best-practices.md: Stem Extraction (3 modes), Keep It Simple (descriptor reframe), V5.5 table (subtle-descriptor hedge), Negative Prompting (dedicated field + group vocals), V5 Key Improvements table (stem row).
- suno-engineer/SKILL.md: descriptor-mix guidance, Exclude Styles, workflow steps, quality checklist.
- creative-sliders.md: Audio Influence × Voices; softened 4-7 cross-refs.
- structure-tags.md, voice-tags.md, templates/track.md: comma-free Performance Cue convention.
- pre-generation-check/SKILL.md + handlers/gates.py: descriptor gate >12 threshold; comma-free cue example.
- mix-engineer/SKILL.md: split-mode cross-reference.
- version-history/v5-changes.md: corrected V5 date.

## 2026-04-12 - V5.5 Research Update

### Features
- **Voices** (Pro/Premier, 4 credits/creation, 18+): voice cloning from 15s–4min of singing with spoken-phrase consent verification; activation requires a broad training-consent opt-in
- **Custom Models** (Pro/Premier, up to 3/account): fine-tune private V5.5 on ≥6 original tracks; 2–5 minute build time
- **My Taste** (all tiers including free): passive preference learning that shapes the style autogenerate feature

### Changes
- **Engine**: improved phrasing nuance, instrument separation, dynamic range, vocal expressiveness — subtle descriptors land more reliably
- **Backward compatibility**: style box (1,000 chars), lyrics box (5,000 chars), metatags, structure tags, sliders, negative prompting all unchanged from V5. No deprecated patterns.
- **Optional prompting adjustments**: drop gender/register descriptors when using Voices; drop generic production language when using Custom Models

### Documentation
- Retitled v5-best-practices.md to cover V5 and V5.5
- Added V5.5 Update summary section at top of v5-best-practices.md
- Added Voices & Custom Models section to v5-best-practices.md
- Added V5.5 personalization summary to tips-and-tricks.md
- Updated suno-engineer skill description to reflect V5/V5.5 scope

---

## 2026-02-04 - V5 Best Practices Research Update

### Features
- **Personas**: Documented creation workflow, best practices, Persona+Cover combinations, December 2025 dominance update
- **Song Editor**: Section-level editing (remake, rewrite, extend, reorder, delete) without full regeneration
- **Bar Count Targeting**: Syntax for targeting specific bar counts per section (e.g., `[VERSE 1 8]`)
- **Creative Sliders**: Weirdness, Style Influence, Audio Influence — documented usage guidance

### Community Tips
- **Prompt fatigue / tag soup**: V5 dilutes attention with 8+ descriptors; sweet spot is 4–7
- **Top-Loaded Palette formula**: `[Mood] + [Energy] + [2 Instruments] + [Vocal Identity]`
- **Token biases**: Suno gravitates toward Neon, Echo, Ghost, Silver, Shadow — model preference, not creative choice
- **Producer's Prompt approach**: Narrative descriptions outperform flat tag lists in V5
- **Sustained notes**: `Loooove`, `Ohhhh` for vocal emphasis; ALL CAPS for shouting
- **Emotion arc mapping**: Different vocal qualities per section for dynamic performance
- **Language isolation**: One language per section for multilingual tracks prevents drift
- **Numbers**: Spell out numbers for reliable pronunciation

### Changes
- **V4.5 comparison note**: V4.5 may produce better results for heavy genres (metal, hardcore)
- **Ownership clarification**: Post-WMG deal — "commercial use rights" but not ownership; model deprecation planned for 2026
- **Catalog protection warning**: Download important generations before licensed models launch
- **V5 Voice Gender selector**: Advanced Options selector documented as most reliable gender control
- **IPA not supported**: Confirmed IPA is not natively supported by Suno
- **V5 context sensitivity**: Improved but phonetic spelling still required for homographs

### Documentation
- Updated v5-best-practices.md: Personas, Song Editor, bar count targeting, Creative Sliders, prompt fatigue, token biases, ownership/licensing, V4.5 comparison
- Updated tips-and-tricks.md: Personas workflow, Covers+Personas, Song Editor, Creative Sliders, catalog protection, expanded WMG context
- Updated voice-tags.md: Voice Gender selector, sustained notes, ALL CAPS, emotion arc mapping, Personas reference
- Updated structure-tags.md: Bar count targeting, performance cues rule, V5 reliability improvements
- Updated pronunciation-guide.md: V5 context sensitivity, IPA note, numbers guidance, multilingual track isolation
- Updated instrumental-tags.md: Producer's Prompt approach, tag soup warning, punctuation solo trick
