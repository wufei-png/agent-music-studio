# Error Recovery Procedures

This document covers edge cases and recovery procedures for common workflow issues.

---

## 1. Wrong Track Marked as Final

**Symptoms**: Discovered quality issues, wrong lyrics, or pronunciation problems after marking a track as Final.

**Prevention**: Always play through the full track before marking Final. Use the lyric-reviewer skill before generation.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Change Status: `Final` → `In Progress`
2. Note reason in Generation Log: "Needs regen - [reason]"
3. Regenerate on Suno
4. Log new attempt with notes
5. When satisfied, mark `Generated` → `Final` again

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Never delete the track file. Always revert status and regenerate. Keep the Generation Log history for reference.

---

## 2. Suno Generation Failed Mid-Batch

**Symptoms**: Some tracks generated successfully, others failed or timed out. Partial album completion.

**Prevention**: Generate 2-3 tracks at a time maximum. Save progress frequently.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify which tracks completed (check Suno dashboard)
2. Update completed tracks: add Suno Links, set Status: `Generated`
3. Note failed tracks in their Generation Logs: "Attempt failed - [error]"
4. Retry failed tracks individually
5. If persistent failures, adjust style prompt or try different time of day

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Keep all partial progress. Only retry failed tracks.

---

## 3. Audio Mastering Corrupted or Wrong Settings

**Symptoms**: Audio sounds distorted, clipped, wrong loudness, or different from expected.

**Prevention**: Always run preview (dry-run) before mastering. Check LUFS/dBTP after mastering. See [mastering-workflow.md](../mastering/mastering-workflow.md) for dry-run procedures and settings.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Rename bad masters: `track.wav` → `track-BAD.wav`
2. Keep original unmastered files (never overwrite originals)
3. Re-run mastering with correct settings
4. Compare A/B against original
5. Delete BAD files only after confirming new masters are correct

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Keep BAD files until new masters are verified. If originals were overwritten, re-download from Suno.

---

## 4. Album Accidentally Released

**Symptoms**: Album marked Released and/or uploaded to platforms before it was ready.

**Prevention**: Use Release Director skill for guided release. Always verify checklist before changing status.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. **If on platforms**: Set tracks to private/unlisted (don't delete yet)
2. Change Status: `Released` → `Complete`
3. Remove or comment out `release_date` field
4. Add "Version History" section in album README documenting the incident
5. Fix whatever issues exist
6. When ready, go through proper release flow again

**When to Delete vs Revert**: On platforms, prefer unlisting over deletion. Deletion may cause issues with future uploads of same content.

---

## 5. Lyrics Mistake After Generation

**Symptoms**: Discovered factual error, typo, or problematic content in lyrics after Suno generation.

**Prevention**: Run lyric-reviewer and pronunciation-specialist before generation. Verify against sources for true-story albums.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Fix lyrics in track file immediately
2. Add note: "Lyrics revised [date] - [reason]"
3. **If track was Final**: Revert to `In Progress`, regenerate
4. **If source-based**: Request re-verification from user
5. Update Generation Log with regeneration notes

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Never delete track file. Always fix in place and regenerate audio if needed.

---

## 6. Duplicate Tracks or Mixed Up File Names

**Symptoms**: Two tracks have same content, files named wrong, or track numbers don't match content.

**Prevention**: Use `/bitwize-music:import-track` skill which validates naming. Review tracklist before generation.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify correct mapping: which file should be which track
2. Rename files to temporary names first: `01-track.md` → `01-track-TEMP.md`
3. Rename to correct names in order
4. Update any Suno Links if they point to wrong tracks
5. Verify tracklist in album README matches file order
6. Update track numbers in frontmatter

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Delete true duplicates (identical content). Rename/reorganize misnamed files.

---

## 7. Wrong Genre/Style Prompt Results

**Symptoms**: Generated audio sounds completely wrong for the intended style. Wrong tempo, mood, or genre.

**Prevention**: Use `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer` for style prompts. Test style on one track before batch generation.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Document what went wrong in Generation Log
2. Analyze: Was it the style prompt, lyrics structure, or Suno interpretation?
3. Revise style prompt (see `/reference/suno/v5-best-practices.md`)
4. Test new prompt on a single track
5. Once working, regenerate affected tracks
6. Save both old and new style prompts for reference

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Keep failed generations in log for learning. Only regenerate audio, don't delete documentation.

---

## 8. Research Sources Incorrect or Outdated

**Symptoms**: Discovered source was unreliable, facts changed, or better sources exist.

**Prevention**: Use source hierarchy (court docs > gov releases > journalism > news). Verify with multiple sources.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Mark affected source in SOURCES.md as `[DEPRECATED]` with note
2. Find replacement source
3. Update RESEARCH.md with corrected information
4. Review all lyrics that used the bad source
5. Reset affected tracks: Status → `Sources Pending`
6. Request re-verification from user
7. Only after verification, proceed with any needed regeneration

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Never delete source entries. Mark deprecated and add replacement. Audit trail matters.

---

## 9. Album Art Rejected or Wrong Dimensions

**Symptoms**: Platform rejects album art, art appears cropped/stretched, or wrong aspect ratio.

**Prevention**: Always use 3000x3000 pixels, sRGB color space, JPEG or PNG under 20MB.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Check rejection reason (dimensions, file size, content policy)
2. Regenerate with correct specs using art director prompt
3. Save new art with version number: `album-art-v2.jpg`
4. Use `/bitwize-music:import-art` to place in correct locations
5. Update album README if art prompt was revised
6. Re-upload to platforms

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Keep old versions (v1, v2) until release is complete. Delete only unused drafts.

---

## 10. Configuration Paths Wrong, Files in Wrong Location

**Symptoms**: Files saved to wrong directory, can't find expected files, path errors in skills.

**Prevention**: Always read `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` before file operations. Use import skills.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Read config to get correct paths
2. Locate misplaced files (check current directory, home, Downloads)
3. Move files to correct location using proper path structure:
   - Content: `{content_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/`
   - Audio: `{audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/`
   - Documents: `{documents_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/`
4. Verify no broken references in track files
5. Run `/bitwize-music:validate-album` to confirm structure

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Move files, don't delete. Only delete after confirming files are in correct location.

---

## 11. Track Numbers Out of Order

**Symptoms**: Tracks display in wrong order, numbering gaps, or doesn't match album flow.

**Prevention**: Plan tracklist before creating files. Use zero-padded numbers (01, 02, not 1, 2).

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Document intended track order
2. Rename files to temporary names: `01-track.md` → `TEMP-01.md`
3. Rename to correct numbers in sequence
4. Update frontmatter `track_number` field in each file
5. Update tracklist in album README
6. Verify Suno Links still point to correct audio
7. If mastered, rename audio files to match

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Never delete. Rename and renumber in place.

---

## 12. Forgot Pronunciation Check, Suno Mispronounced Words

**Symptoms**: Generated audio has mispronounced names, homographs read wrong, or acronyms spoken as words.

**Prevention**: ALWAYS run `/bitwize-music:pronunciation-specialist` before generation. Check homographs (live, lead, read, wind, tear, bass, close).

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify all mispronounced words in the track
2. Run pronunciation-specialist on lyrics
3. Apply phonetic spellings to Lyrics Box:
   - Names: "Ramos" → "Rah-mohs"
   - Acronyms: "FBI" → "F-B-I"
   - Homographs: "live" → "lyve" or "liv"
4. Update track file with corrected lyrics
5. Regenerate on Suno
6. Verify pronunciation in new generation

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Keep original in Generation Log. Regenerate with corrected lyrics.

---

## 13. State Cache Corrupted or Stale

**Symptoms**: Albums missing from `list_albums`/`find_album`, wrong statuses or titles after a manual file edit, MCP tools return "Run rebuild_state first", `diagnose` reports state_cache "Cannot parse state.json", or `album_collisions` looks stale.

**Prevention**: Prefer MCP tools (which write the cache atomically) over hand-editing files. Never edit `~/.bitwize-music/cache/state.json` directly — it's a derived cache, not source data. The cache auto-reloads when `state.json` or `config.yaml` mtime changes and auto-rebuilds on a schema-version bump.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Run `diagnose` (or `health_check`) and read the `state_cache` check to confirm the cache is the problem
2. Run the `rebuild_state` MCP tool to regenerate `state.json` from the markdown files on disk
3. If the rebuild reports `collision_count` > 0, resolve the slug collision (rename one album with `/bitwize-music:rename` or move its directory), then `rebuild_state` again
4. If `state.json` is unparseable and rebuild still fails, delete `~/.bitwize-music/cache/state.json` and run `rebuild_state` (it recreates the file from scratch)
5. Verify with `list_albums` that albums and statuses match reality

**Note on auto-recovery (#383/#381/#398)**: When a `rename`/move operation returns `cache_rebuilt: true`, the server already detected a cache divergence and rebuilt from disk for you — no action needed. If it instead returns a `warning` telling you to run `rebuild_state`, the automatic recovery failed and you must run it manually before trusting album lookups.

**When to Delete vs Revert**: `state.json` is a rebuildable cache — always safe to delete and rebuild. Never delete the markdown files it's built from.

---

## 14. Mastering Pipeline Failed Mid-Run

**Symptoms**: Mastering crashed or was interrupted partway. `mastered/` (or `polished/`, `mastering_samples/`) holds partial, zero-byte, or wrong-count WAVs. Some tracks mastered, others not.

**Prevention**: Always run the mastering dry-run/preview first (see [mastering-workflow.md](../mastering/mastering-workflow.md)). Never master over `originals/` — the pipeline reads from originals and writes to `mastered/`.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Run `reset_mastering` with `dry_run=True` (the default) to see exactly what's in `mastered/` and how much would be removed
2. Once the report looks right, re-run with `dry_run=False` to delete the partial output. Add `subfolders: ["mastered", "polished", "mastering_samples"]` if the polish or sample folders are also partial
3. `originals/` and `stems/` are protected — `reset_mastering` refuses to touch them, so your source audio is safe
4. Confirm `originals/` still holds the unmastered WAVs, then re-run mastering from a clean slate
5. If only a few tracks failed, re-master just those instead of resetting the whole folder

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Delete partial mastered output via `reset_mastering`, never by hand (hand-deletion risks the protected `originals/`/`stems/`). Keep originals always.

---

## 15. Malformed Track or Album Markdown

**Symptoms**: A track or album is missing from `list_albums`/`get_track`, shows blank or wrong fields, or `rebuild_state` skips it. Frontmatter YAML won't parse (unquoted colon, bad indentation, missing closing `---`), or required sections/fields are absent.

**Prevention**: Edit track/album files through the skills (`/bitwize-music:import-track`, status via `update_track_field`) rather than hand-editing frontmatter. Keep both `---` fences and start from the templates in `{plugin_root}/templates/`.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Run `/bitwize-music:validate-album <album-name>` to pinpoint the broken file and the missing or invalid fields
2. Open the flagged markdown and fix the structure: matching `---` frontmatter fences top and bottom, valid YAML (quote any value containing `:`), and a valid `title`. Note the parser reads `Status` from the **Track Details** table, *not* frontmatter, and derives the track number from the file's zero-padded name prefix (`01-`, `02-`) rather than any field — repair a wrong status in that table (or via `update_track_field`) and fix ordering by renaming the file, not by editing frontmatter
3. Compare against a healthy sibling track or the template if unsure of the schema
4. Run `rebuild_state` so the corrected file is re-indexed
5. Confirm with `get_track`/`list_albums` that the fields now read correctly

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Never delete the file — fix the frontmatter in place. If a file is hopelessly corrupted, restore it from git (`git checkout HEAD -- path/to/track.md`) rather than recreating it by hand.

---

## 16. Batch Operation Partially Completed

**Symptoms**: A batch action (approving all Generated tracks → Final, or a bulk status update) stopped partway. Some tracks advanced, others still show the old status; the album status didn't advance because one track lagged.

**Prevention**: Batch status changes apply one track at a time — each `update_track_field` call is its own atomic write, so no single file is ever left half-written. Note which tracks you intend to change before starting.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Run `list_albums`/`get_track` (or `/bitwize-music:album-dashboard`) to see which tracks were and weren't updated
2. Re-run the operation only on the tracks that were missed — each write is atomic and idempotent, so re-applying a field that's already set is harmless
3. If the cache looks out of sync with the files after the partial run, run `rebuild_state`
4. Confirm the album status advanced once all tracks reached the target level (all `Final` → album `Complete`)

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Nothing to delete — re-apply the remaining updates. Atomic per-track writes mean already-changed tracks are safe; only the un-changed ones need action.

---

## 17. Config Path Resolution Fails (Missing Directories, Broken Symlinks)

**Symptoms**: Skills error that a root path doesn't exist; `diagnose` reports config "does not exist: <path>" or "Missing required config field"; a `content_root`/`audio_root`/`documents_root` points at a deleted directory or a broken symlink; content "vanishes" because its root moved. (Distinct from Scenario 10, where config is correct but files landed in the wrong place.)

**Prevention**: Keep `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` pointing at real, existing directories. After moving a content/audio/documents root, update config the same session.

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Run `diagnose` and read the `config` check — it lists every missing field and every root path that doesn't resolve
2. If a directory was moved or deleted, recreate/restore it or update the path in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` (use `/bitwize-music:configure` for a guided edit)
3. For a broken symlink, repoint it at the real target (`ln -sfn <target> <link>`) or replace it with a real directory
4. Editing `config.yaml` changes its mtime, so the cache reloads automatically; if paths still look wrong, run `rebuild_state`
5. Re-run `diagnose` to confirm all paths resolve

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Fix or restore directories — don't delete content. Only the config path values change; the album files stay put.

---

## 18. Plugin Corrupted or MCP Server Broken

**Symptoms**: MCP tools unavailable or erroring at session start; `health_check` reports missing or ghost skills; skills you expect don't appear; the `bitwize-music-mcp` server fails to start (import errors, missing venv).

**Prevention**: Install and upgrade via the marketplace (`claude plugin update bitwize-music`) rather than editing the cached plugin. Keep the venv in sync (session-start venv check / `check_venv_health`).

**Recovery Steps**:
1. If MCP tools are entirely unavailable, the server didn't start — run `/bitwize-music:setup` (or `/bitwize-music:setup mcp`) to detect the Python environment and reinstall dependencies. Quick check: `~/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/python3 -c "import mcp.server.fastmcp"` (macOS/Linux/WSL) or `~/.bitwize-music/venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "import mcp.server.fastmcp"` (Windows; cmd/PowerShell: `%USERPROFILE%\.bitwize-music\venv\Scripts\python.exe`). Probe the submodule, not bare `mcp` — mcp 2.x imports fine but dropped `mcp.server.fastmcp`, so a bare `import mcp` reports healthy on an install the server cannot boot on ([#537](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/537))
2. If the server runs but skills are missing/ghost, `health_check` will say so — run `claude plugin update bitwize-music` to refresh the plugin cache, then restart the session
3. If `health_check` reports skills `no_cache`, the plugin isn't installed via the marketplace — reinstall it (or use `--plugin-dir` for local development)
4. If the venv is stale or missing (`check_venv_health` → `stale`/`no_venv`), run the reported `pip install -r requirements.txt` fix, or `/bitwize-music:setup` to rebuild the venv
5. Once tools respond, run `rebuild_state` and `diagnose` to confirm a clean baseline

**When to Delete vs Revert**: Reinstall or refresh the plugin and venv rather than hand-patching cached skill files. Your content lives under the config roots, not in the plugin cache, so a plugin reinstall never touches your albums.

## Emergency Recovery

For major disasters (data loss, corrupted files, accidental mass deletion):

### Immediate Actions
1. **STOP** - Don't make more changes
2. Check git status: `git status` - are changes committed?
3. Check git log: `git log --oneline -10` - find last good state
4. If uncommitted changes lost: Check file recovery (Trash, Time Machine, etc.)

### Git Recovery
- Recover deleted file: `git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file`
- Revert to previous commit: `git checkout [commit-hash] -- path/to/file`
- See what changed: `git diff HEAD~1`

### Suno Recovery
- All generations saved in Suno account history
- Re-download any needed audio from Suno dashboard
- Check "Library" for all past generations

### When All Else Fails
1. Export what you can (lyrics from track files, notes from READMEs)
2. Document what was lost
3. Start fresh with `/bitwize-music:new-album`
4. Import salvaged content

## When to Start Over

Sometimes a fresh start is better than fixing. Consider starting over when:

- **More than 50% of tracks need major changes** - Faster to rebuild than fix
- **Concept fundamentally changed** - New album is cleaner than retrofitting
- **Source material was entirely wrong** - Research needs complete redo
- **File structure is unsalvageable** - Missing files, broken references everywhere
- **Learning curve issues** - Early album before you understood the workflow

### How to Start Over Cleanly
1. Rename old album directory: `album-name` → `album-name-OLD`
2. Create fresh album: `/bitwize-music:new-album album-name genre`
3. Salvage what works from OLD version (copy specific content)
4. Delete OLD directory only after new album is complete
5. Document lessons learned for future reference

### What to Salvage
- Research that's still valid (RESEARCH.md, SOURCES.md)
- Lyrics that worked well
- Style prompts that produced good results
- Generation Log notes about what worked/failed

### What NOT to Salvage
- Broken file structures
- Unverified sources
- Lyrics with known issues
- Style prompts that failed
