## V5.5 Update (March 26, 2026)

V5.5 is an evolution of V5, not a break from it. **Prompt syntax, metatags, structure tags, creative sliders, the 1,000-character style box, and the 5,000-character lyrics box are all unchanged** — V5 prompts run identically on V5.5. No patterns are deprecated.

What changed is engine responsiveness and personalization:

| Change | Impact on prompting |
|--------|---------------------|
| Nuanced phrasing, stronger dynamic range | Worth trying finer descriptors (e.g., "slightly detuned vintage keys") — improved nuance is engine-reported, not independently verified |
| Better instrument separation | Busy arrangements stay readable — less mud on dense prompts |
| More expressive vocals | Emotion tags (breathy, yearning, resigned) track closer to intent |
| Voices (Pro/Premier) | Voice cloning replaces vocal persona descriptors — see below |
| Custom Models (Pro/Premier) | Fine-tuned model carries style — style prompts can be shorter |
| My Taste (all tiers) | Passive preference learning; affects style autogenerate, not explicit prompts |

**Practical guidance**: keep doing what V5 prompting teaches. If anything, trust the engine more — a touch less over-specification, a touch more reliance on one or two evocative descriptors.

See the [Voices & Custom Models](#voices--custom-models) section below for the V5.5-only features.

## Quick Start Formula

```
[genre], [subgenre], [instruments], [mood], [tempo], [vocal description]
```

**Example**:
```
nerdcore hip-hop, glitchy IDM beats, lo-fi digital artifacts,
nostalgic, melancholic, 85 BPM, male vocals, gravelly voice, introspective
```

---

## V5 Key Improvements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Intelligent Composition | Coherent structure from 30-second hooks to 8-minute epics |
| Studio-Grade Audio | 44.1 kHz output with fuller, more balanced mixes |
| Vocal Engine | Human-like vocals with breath, emotion, vibrato control |
| 10x Faster | Seconds instead of minutes for generation |
| Stem Separation (3 modes) | Auto Split (12 stems), Split from Mix (target + the rest), Advanced Split (~100 instruments) — Auto Split output shows bleed/shared reverb in practice; see § Stem Extraction |
| Extended Length | Up to 8 minutes per generation |
| Persistent Memory | Vocal characters and instruments remain stable across project generations |
| Granular Controls | Tempo, key, dynamics, arrangement with optional automation |

## Critical Rule: Don't Reuse Old Prompts

**Suno CTO's #1 recommendation**: Don't rerun old V4/V4.5 prompts on V5.

V5 listens differently and needs less instruction. Write new prompts and experiment.

---

## Prompt Construction

### Keep It Simple — Avoid Prompt Fatigue

V5 is literal, and it dilutes attention when descriptors repeat the same idea. **Every descriptor should earn its place** — genre, instrument, vocal identity, production texture, mood, tempo. A focused style box of ~10 descriptors works well; what hurts is a *synonym-pile* (five mood words that all mean "soft") that gives V5 nothing new to act on.

> **On the "4–7 descriptors" rule of thumb**: 4–7 is a useful starting point, **not a Suno-official rule**. Rich ~10-descriptor style boxes are common and effective when every term does distinct work. Trim *synonyms*, not *detail*. (The hard "cut everything past 7" version of this rule traces to a single third-party guide and isn't borne out in practice — real style boxes routinely run richer.)

```
❌ Bad (synonym-pile — overlapping mood words that add nothing new):
"Ethereal indie folk with vintage analog warmth and melancholic
undertones, finger-picked acoustic, tape hiss, lo-fi, intimate,
breathy, whispery, nostalgic, contemplative, minimalist production"

❌ Bad (too vague):
"Nice upbeat music"

✅ Good (every descriptor pulls its weight):
"Sad indie folk, acoustic, gentle, breathy female vocal, intimate"
```

**Rule of thumb**: if descriptors start restating the same idea (intimate / breathy / whispery / soft), collapse them into one. Don't pad — but don't strip out genuinely distinct instrument, vocal, or production detail just to hit a number.

### The Four-Part Anatomy

```
1. Genre + Era + Influences
   "90s alt-rock with Britpop undertones"

2. Tempo/BPM + Key (optional)
   "120 BPM, A minor"

3. Instrumentation & Arrangement
   "Live drums with room ambience; palm-muted guitars; warm bass"

4. Production & Mix Notes
   "Analog glue compression; tape saturation; lead vocal upfront"
```

### Alternative: Top-Loaded Palette Formula

A simpler approach that front-loads the most impactful elements:

```
[Mood] + [Energy] + [2 Instruments] + [Vocal Identity]
```

**Example**:
```
Melancholic, slow-burn, piano and strings, female alto with subtle vibrato
```

## Genre-Specific Tips

### Hip-Hop / Rap
- Specify subgenre: boom bap, trap, lo-fi, nerdcore
- Include beat style: 808s, sampled drums, crispy snares
- Describe flow if important

### Punk
- Specify subgenre: pop-punk, hardcore, skate punk
- Note tempo (punk is usually fast)
- Describe vocal style: snotty, shouted, melodic

### Electronic
- Name specific subgenres: house, techno, IDM, synthwave
- Describe synth types: analog, digital, chiptune
- Include BPM (critical for dance music)

### Folk/Acoustic
- Specify instruments: fingerpicking, banjo, mandolin
- Note tempo and mood
- Describe vocal intimacy level

### K-Pop

K-pop presents unique challenges for Suno due to its maximalist production, multi-vocal architecture, language mixing, and mid-song genre shifts.

**Core style prompt approach:**
- Always include `K-pop` explicitly plus specific production terms (`maximalist`, `glossy`, `dynamic shifts`)
- Place vocal description first: `mixed group vocals, layered harmonies, K-pop idol group`
- Specify concept type: `girl crush`, `cute concept`, `dark concept`, `retro disco`
- Include BPM (dance tracks: 120-140, ballads: 60-80, hip-hop: 80-100)

**Getting the group vocal sound:**
- `mixed group vocals` is the single most important tag for simulating a multi-member group
- Add `layered harmonies`, `gang vocals`, `group chant` for chorus density
- Use parenthetical backing vocals in lyrics: `I'm on fire (on fire!)` to trigger echo/response
- Use `[All]` or `[Group]` section tags before chant sections
- Separate rap verses with `[Rap Verse]` tags to signal a different vocal character

**Korean-English code-switching:**
- Suno V5 handles Korean (Hangul) better than earlier versions, but romanized Korean with hyphens remains more reliable for pronunciation control
- Format: `Sa-rang-hae` not `Saranghae`
- Add `[Clear Vocals]` or `[High Fidelity Vocals]` when mixing languages
- Keep English hooks and Korean verses as separate sections when possible

**The "switch-up" (mid-song genre change):**
- Use parenthetical genre cues at each section, not just in the global style prompt:
  ```
  [Verse 1]
  (Soft R&B groove, gentle piano)
  ...lyrics...

  [Chorus]
  (Explosive EDM drop, heavy bass, full energy)
  ...lyrics...

  [Rap Verse]
  (Aggressive trap flow, 808 bass)
  ...lyrics...

  [Bridge]
  (Stripped-back ballad, solo piano)
  ...lyrics...
  ```
- Include `genre-fluid`, `dynamic shifts`, `maximalist K-pop production` in style prompt

**K-pop section structure (more sections than Western pop):**
- Intro → Verse 1 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Post-Chorus → Verse 2 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Rap Verse → Bridge → Dance Break → Final Chorus (key change up) → Outro
- Use `[Dance Break]` with `(Instrumental, heavy beat)` and minimal/no lyrics
- Final chorus often modulates up a half-step — note `(key change up, maximum energy)` in parenthetical

**Common K-pop Suno issues:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Sounds like generic pop, not K-pop | Add `K-pop` + `maximalist` + `glossy` + specific concept keywords |
| Solo voice instead of group | Add `mixed group vocals`, `layered harmonies`, `K-pop idol group` |
| No genre switch-up mid-song | Use parenthetical genre cues per section, not just global prompt |
| Korean pronunciation garbled | Use romanized Korean with hyphens; add `[Clear Vocals]` |
| Rap verse sounds same as singing | Use `[Rap Verse]` tag with `(aggressive rap flow)` parenthetical |
| Dance break has singing | Keep lyrics minimal/empty in `[Dance Break]`; add `(Instrumental)` |

**Example K-pop style prompts by concept:**

Girl crush:
```
K-pop girl group, fierce EDM trap, sassy vocals, heavy bass drop, chant chorus, 135 BPM, confident attitude, glossy production
```

Bright/cute:
```
K-pop, bubblegum pop, bright synths, chirpy vocals, catchy hook, youthful energy, 125 BPM, layered harmonies
```

Dark/experimental:
```
K-pop, industrial synths, aggressive rap, EDM bass drops, distorted bass, maximalist chaos, 140 BPM, mixed group vocals
```

K-ballad:
```
Korean ballad, emotional piano, string orchestra, soaring vocals, key change final chorus, 70 BPM, cinematic, lush arrangement
```

---

## Vocal Control

### Top-Anchor Approach

Start your prompt with vocal description before lyrics:

```
Female pop vocalist, breathy, intimate, 90s R&B groove

[Verse 1]
Lying in the dark tonight...
```

### Vocal Persona Examples

```
Male tenor, warm, slightly raspy, indie rock delivery
```
```
Female alto, sultry, breathy, R&B phrasing with subtle runs
```
```
Male baritone, gravelly, introspective, folk storyteller
```

### Section-by-Section Dynamics

| Section | Dynamics | Phrasing | Vibrato |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| Verse | Low | Tight | Minimal |
| Pre-Chorus | Rising | Shorter | Growing |
| Chorus | High/Open | Sustained | Full |
| Bridge | Variable | New texture | Altered |

---

## Lyric Formatting

### Keep Lyrics Concise

Shorter lyrics generate better results. Dense or long lyrics cause Suno to rush, compress sections, or skip content entirely. Target **200–350 words** for most genres (up to 500 for hip-hop/rap). Two verses plus chorus plus bridge is the sweet spot — avoid 4–5 verse songs.

### Use Explicit Section Tags

```
[Verse 1]
Walking through the rain tonight
Memories fading out of sight

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still remember when

[Chorus]
We were young and free
```

### Sound Effects

Trigger vocal sound effects by placing them in brackets:

```
[Verse 1]
Walking through the night [footsteps]
I hear a voice calling [echo]
Then suddenly [laughter] breaks the silence
```

**Common Effects**:

**Human:**
- `[laughter]` - Natural laughing
- `[screaming]` - Vocal scream
- `[whisper]` - Whispered delivery
- `[sigh]` - Breathing out, reflective
- `[gasp]` - Sharp intake of breath
- `[cough]` - Clearing throat, realistic aside

**Crowd:**
- `[crowd]` - Crowd noise
- `[applause]` - Clapping/applause
- `[cheering]` - Crowd excitement

**Mechanical/transition:**
- `[echo]` - Echo/reverb effect
- `[phone ringing]` - Telephone sound, narrative device
- `[static]` - Radio noise, transition
- `[record scratch]` - DJ/hip-hop transition marker

**Note**: Effects work best when placed mid-line, not as standalone lines

### Atmospheric Effects

For environmental sounds (rain, wind, fire), mention in **both** the Lyrics Box and Style Prompt:

**Lyrics Box**:
```
[Verse]
Rain falling on the window
Thunder in the distance
```

**Style Prompt**:
```
lofi effects rain, ambient thunder
```

**Why Both?**: Repetition strengthens AI recognition of desired atmosphere

**Common Atmospheres**:
- `rain` + "lofi effects rain" (style prompt)
- `wind` + "ambient wind textures" (style prompt)
- `fire` + "crackling fire ambience" (style prompt)
- `ocean` + "ocean waves background" (style prompt)

### Syllable Control

- **Verse lines**: 7–9 syllables per line for best vocal lock-in
- **Chorus lines**: 10–12 syllables per line
- **Overall range**: 6–12 syllables per line
- Use hyphens for sustained notes: `lo-ove`, `sooo-long`
- Writing `Loooove` or `Ohhhh` creates sustained notes and vocal emphasis
- ALL CAPS can create a shouting effect: `NEVER AGAIN`
- Punctuation signals phrasing: commas = pauses, ellipses = trailing

### Prevent Lyric Alterations

Add at the top of your prompt:
```
Do not change any words. Sing exactly as written.
```

---

## Negative Prompting

Exclusions **shift the odds** against an element — they're probabilistic, not a hard filter, and won't override a prompt that strongly implies the thing you're excluding.

**Two ways to exclude:**
- **Dedicated Exclude Styles field** (Custom Mode → Advanced Options, **Pro/Premier**) — the reliable path. Put exclusions here, not buried in the main style prompt.
- **Inline `no [element]`** appended to the style box — the fallback when you don't have the field (free tier). Weaker; the engine may still slip the element in.

Keep it to **2–4 items** — over-specifying dilutes the effect.

### What You Can Exclude
- Instruments: "no drums", "no electric guitar"
- Vocal effects: "no autotune", "no heavy reverb"
- Stylistic elements: "no EDM drops", "no screaming"
- **Unwanted group vocals** (a common Suno over-add): "no choir", "no crowd vocals", "no backing vocals", "no gang vocals", "no call-and-response", "no vocal harmonies", "no layered vocals"

### Best Practices

```
✅ Good:
"Acoustic folk, warm, intimate, no drums, no electric instruments"

❌ Bad (over-specified):
"No drums, no bass, no synths, no reverb, no distortion, no..."
```

> **Group vocals** are probabilistic to suppress: excluding "choir / crowd / backing vocals" improves your odds, but a big anthemic prompt can still pull them back in. Pair the exclusion with a leaner, more intimate style prompt for the strongest effect.

---

## Bar Count Targeting

V5 supports targeting specific bar counts per section using numbers after section tags:

```
[INTRO 4] [VERSE 1 8] [PRE 4] [CHORUS 8] [VERSE 2 8] [PRE 4] [CHORUS 8] [BRIDGE 8] [CHORUS 8] [OUTRO 4]
```

The numbers represent target bar counts for each section. This gives you finer control over song structure and pacing beyond just section tags.

**Notes**:
- Results are approximate — Suno treats these as targets, not guarantees
- Combine with explicit section tags in the lyrics box for best results
- Works well for controlling intro/outro length

---

## Creative Sliders

V5 includes sliders in the generation interface that affect output:

| Slider | Effect | Guidance |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Weirdness** | Higher = more experimental and unexpected choices | Raise to explore; lower for predictable, hooky results |
| **Style Influence** | Higher = tighter adherence to style prompt | Raise for genre purity; lower for looser fusions |
| **Audio Influence** | Controls how much uploaded audio shapes the output | Appears only when audio is uploaded |

**Tips**:
- Start with default values and adjust after hearing the first generation
- High Weirdness + specific genre tag = interesting results within a genre
- Low Style Influence is useful when you want the AI to surprise you

> **Deep dive**: [creative-sliders.md](creative-sliders.md) — per-slider behavior, genre starting ranges, interaction effects, and when to move a slider vs. rewrite the prompt.

## Voices & Custom Models

**V5.5 only. Pro and Premier subscribers.**

### Voices (voice cloning)

Upload a clean acapella, a full track with background music, or sing directly into a mic (15 seconds to 4 minutes of material — the cleaner, the less needed). Suno then has you read a random spoken phrase aloud and matches it to the uploaded audio as a consent/ownership check. Cloned voices are private to the account; sharing is announced but not yet live.

- **Cost**: 4 credits per creation (beta pricing).
- **Consent box is mandatory** — activating Voices grants Suno permission to use your voice data to train their models broadly, not just your private instance. This is not optional for activation.
- **Age-gated**: 18+.

**Prompting with a Voice**:
- Drop gender/register descriptors from the style box — the Voice carries them. Free that budget for genre, instrumentation, and mood.
- Voice + Persona is redundant; pick one.
- Keep the style prompt to 1–2 genres plus instrumentation, same as the Personas rule.

### Custom Models (fine-tuning)

Upload **at least 6 original tracks** from your catalog. Suno fine-tunes a private V5.5 on your harmonic preferences, arrangement habits, instrumentation choices, and production aesthetic. Build time: 2–5 minutes. Up to **3 models per account**, maintained concurrently.

**Prompting with a Custom Model**:
- Drop generic production language ("glossy", "modern pop production", "polished mix") — the model already encodes your aesthetic.
- Keep genre and section-level direction. Specific one-off choices (tempo, featured instrument, mood shift) still matter.
- Best for series/album consistency. Generic v5.5 is often better for deliberately off-brand tracks.

### My Taste (all tiers, including free)

Runs passively in the background, learning genres, moods, and styles from your activity. It shapes the **style autogenerate** feature — it does not override explicit prompts. No action required, but worth knowing it exists when the autogenerate button starts reading your mind.

---

## Personas

**Available to**: Pro and Premier subscribers

Personas let you save the "essence" of a generated song — vocals, style, vibe — and reuse it across different songs. This is the most reliable way to maintain vocal consistency across an album.

### Creating a Persona

1. Generate a song with vocals you like
2. Save the song's vocal identity as a Persona
3. Apply the Persona to future generations

### Best Practices

- **Keep prompts simple when using Personas** (1–2 genres). The Persona carries the vocal identity, so you don't need to re-describe the voice.
- **Personas can be dominant** — if your style prompt fights the Persona, the Persona usually wins. Work with it, not against it.
- **Voice Personas lock in a specific AI singer** independent of musical style. You can move a Persona across genres (e.g., same singer doing folk and electronic).

### Limitations

- 200 free songs with Personas per billing cycle; then 10 credits per song
- December 2025 update made Personas more dominant in the mix — adjust style prompts if the Persona is overpowering other elements

---

## Song Editor

V5 includes a section-level Song Editor that lets you modify individual parts of a generated song without regenerating the whole track.

### Capabilities

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Remake** | Regenerate a section with the same prompt |
| **Rewrite** | Change lyrics/melody for a section while preserving role and intent |
| **Extend** | Append bars at the tail of a section |
| **Reorder** | Move sections around in the arrangement |
| **Delete** | Remove weak sections; transitions are engine-handled |

### Workflow

1. Generate a full song
2. Identify sections that need improvement
3. Use Remake/Rewrite on individual sections
4. Extend 1–2 bars into/out of a chorus for smooth transitions
5. Delete weak regions — the engine handles transition smoothing

**Note**: Keep extensions to 2–3 times max per song. Extending too many times causes uneven lyrics, weaker vocals, and quality drops.

---

## Token Biases Warning

Suno's model has known token biases — it gravitates toward certain words when generating or interpreting lyrics. These are model preferences, not creative choices:

**Common bias words**: Neon, Echo, Ghost, Silver, Shadow, Whisper, Crystal, Velvet

If you find these words appearing in your generations when you didn't write them, it's the model defaulting to its favorites. Use the "Do not change any words. Sing exactly as written." instruction to prevent unwanted substitutions.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Vocal too buried | Add: "lead vocal 1–2 dB louder than band" |
| Mix feels flat | Add: "bus compression 2–3 dB, slow attack/fast release" |
| Arrangement too busy | Specify rests: "verse 2: bass rests for 4 bars" |
| Genre drift | Reassert influences mid-prompt |
| Chorus not lifting | Add: "double-time hats; octave guitars" |

---

## Suno Output Loudness (Pre-Mastering)

These are typical loudness levels Suno generates — **not** final mastering targets. For streaming platform delivery, master all tracks to **-14 LUFS / -1.0 dBTP** regardless of genre. See `/reference/mastering/mastering-workflow.md` for mastering procedures.

| Genre | Typical Suno Output |
|-------|---------------------|
| Pop/EDM | -9 to -7 LUFS |
| Lo-Fi | -12 to -11 LUFS |
| Podcast/Spoken | -16 to -14 LUFS |

---

## Iteration Tips

1. **Start broad**, then refine
2. **Log every attempt** - note what worked/didn't
3. **Adjust one element at a time** when refining
4. **Try different models** - V4.5 vs V5 produce different results
5. **Use extends** to build on good sections

---

## Stem Extraction

Suno's stem separation was overhauled in June 2026 into **three selectable modes**. Suno's own materials describe the new pipeline as "listening to" the finished track and regenerating each stem from scratch with its latest model, rather than slicing the mix apart by frequency — the company frames this as why pulls sound cleaner than the old approach. That claim is Suno's own and hasn't been independently verified; some independent write-ups instead describe **Auto Split** specifically as classic frequency/spectral-mask separation, with the regenerative framing applying most clearly to **Advanced Split**.

In practice, stems pulled via **Auto Split** — the mode most people reach for — still show behavior consistent with post-hoc source separation performed on the rendered stereo mix: bleed/crosstalk between stems, reverb embedded and shared across multiple stems, and separation artifacts. Auto Split also returns a file for every one of the 12 stem categories even when the source has none of that content — expect a near-silent (~-55 dBFS) placeholder stem, not an omission. Plan mix polish around these observed behaviors, not around an assumption that "generative" means artifact-free or independently synthesized.

### Split Modes

| Mode | What it does | Output |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Auto Split** | The classic model — splits a song into 12 stem categories at once | 12 stems |
| **Split from Mix** | Pulls one chosen instrument or voice out of the mix | 2 stems: the target, and everything-else-without-it |
| **Advanced Split** | Extracts one specific instrument chosen from a list of ~100 (drum kit to didgeridoo) | 1 targeted stem *(Premier; per-extraction credit cost)* |

**Auto Split — the 12 stems:**
```
Vocals, Backing Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar,
Keyboard, Strings, Brass, Woodwinds,
Percussion, Synth, FX/Other
```

### Extraction Workflow

1. Click **More Actions (...)** on any clip
2. Hover over **Get Stems**
3. Choose your split mode — **Auto Split** (all 12), **Split from Mix** (one target + the rest), or **Advanced Split** (one instrument from ~100)
4. Import into DAW

### Cleaner Single-Stem Pulls

For an isolated vocal or instrument, **Split from Mix** targeting that part is usually cleaner in one pass than the old carve-and-repeat trick. If a stem still bleeds — a real possibility even with the new pipeline, see § Stem Extraction above — run extraction again on the extracted stem.

> **Tier note:** Advanced Split is Premier-tier with a per-extraction credit cost (exact costs vary — check Suno's current pricing). Auto Split / Split from Mix availability follows your plan.

## Known V5 Limitations

- Heavy electric guitars can sound "dirty" or blend together
- Acoustic nuance not always captured perfectly
- Niche subgenres (metalcore, extreme styles) may miss hallmarks
- Extreme cross-style fusions → muddy results
- Quality may degrade past 6-7 minutes
- **V4.5 may produce better results for heavy genres** (metal, hardcore) — consider testing both if V5 output sounds thin

---

## Ownership & Licensing (Post-November 2025)

Following the Warner Music Group partnership (November 2025):

- Subscribers get **"commercial use rights"** but are **"generally not considered the owner"** of generated content
- Suno will **not take a revenue share** from monetization
- Artists/songwriters retain full control over name/image/likeness/voice use
- New models trained on **licensed WMG catalog** are planned for 2026
