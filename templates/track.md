## Cover / Persona Setup

### Original Song Reference

*What this cover reworks. Delete this subsection if the track is not a Cover.*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cover of** | [Original song, or the prior generation this reworks] |
| **Source audio** | [Uploaded sample e.g. Splice / earlier Suno generation / — ] |
| **Keeps** | [What carries over: topline melody, structure] |
| **Reimagines** | [The new target genre/style the Cover shifts it into] |
| **Audio Influence** | [Slider setting — higher hews closer to the source; shown only when audio is uploaded] |

### Persona Selection

*The saved vocal identity applied to this track. Delete this subsection if no Persona is used.*

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Persona** | [Saved Persona name, or —] |
| **Vocal identity** | [What it locks in, e.g. male baritone, gravelly, folk storyteller] |
| **Saved from** | [The generation this Persona was captured from] |

When a Persona is applied, keep the Style Box below simple (one or two genres) and drop detailed
vocal descriptors — the Persona carries the voice. Personas run dominant in the mix; if the result
sounds overprocessed, simplify the Style Box or lower Style Influence.

### Cover-Specific Style Guidance

The Style Box for a Cover describes the NEW target style, not the original. Fill the Style Box under
Suno Inputs below with the destination genre/mood, then note here what to preserve versus transform:

- **Preserve**: [elements of the original to keep — e.g. topline melody, song structure]
- **Transform**: [what the Cover changes — genre, instrumentation, tempo feel, production era]
- **Layering**: [if stacking multiple Covers for genre-bending, note the order — see workflow guide]
