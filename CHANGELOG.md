## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **A track can declare its own `genre:` in frontmatter, and `get_lyrics_stats` now resolves the word-count target per track** — the target came from `album.get("genre")`, which the indexer sets to the album's parent directory name, so it was always the directory the album was filed under. That is fine for a single-genre album and wrong for one that deliberately spans several: a sung-through musical, a soundtrack, a compilation. Every track on a `pop` album was judged against 150–250 words even where one of them was a four-minute rap verse. Resolution is now track genre → album genre → default, so declaring `genre: hip-hop` on that one track gets it judged at 300–500 while its neighbours keep the album's band. The per-track `genre` and `target` are reported on each row, and the `note` names the genre the target actually came from rather than the album's — previously it claimed the album genre even when the number came from elsewhere. The album-level `genre` and `target` in the summary keep their existing meaning.
- Frontmatter `genre:` on a track is optional and absent by default; nothing changes for albums that do not use it. It is a **musical descriptor only** — the album's `genre` stays the parent directory name, because ~7 handler sites resolve album paths from it, so it has to keep matching the directory. `templates/track.md` carries the key commented out and `reference/state-schema.md` documents it on the track table. Both indexing paths carry it — the full scan and the incremental re-parse — held together by a parity test, since a field written by one path and dropped by the other is the drift [#523](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/523) fixed for `tracks_completed`.

### Changed
- **Dependency bumps that the grouped PR could not deliver: `ruff` 0.16.0 → 0.16.2, `boto3` 1.43.56 → 1.43.69, `playwright` 1.61.0 → 1.62.0** — these three were safe the whole time, but rode in a `pip-all` group PR alongside two upgrades that cannot land, so all three sat unmerged. Split out and verified on their own. `ruff` matters most of the three: it is one of the exactly-pinned gate tools from [#532](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/532), so its verdict changes on unchanged code — 0.16.2 was run against the full tree (`tools/`, `servers/`, `hooks/`, plus the scoped `PLW1514` preview pass) and reports no new findings.
- **`librosa` 1.0+ is blocked in `.github/dependabot.yml`, on the same Python-floor grounds as `scipy` and `numpy`** — `librosa` 1.0.0 declares `Requires-Python >=3.12` and the plugin supports 3.11, so pip cannot resolve it at all: `No matching distribution found for librosa==1.0.0`. That is worse than a failing test. Every job that installs `requirements.txt` dies at the install step, `pip-audit` included, which is why the group PR carrying it failed 11 checks rather than the 6 that mcp alone accounts for. It joins the existing ignore block, whose comment now also records *why* this class of upgrade is blocked rather than merely which packages are affected. ([#532](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/532)) — `requirements.txt` pinned all 16 runtime deps with `==`, but every entry in `requirements-test.txt` used `>=`, so `ruff`, `mypy` and `bandit` resolved to whatever was newest on PyPI at the moment CI ran. Those three decide the Lint and Security Scan verdicts, and unlike a test runner they change their answer on unchanged code — a new rule or a widened check reddens a commit nobody touched, and re-running an old green build no longer reproduces it. The drift was already visible: the file read `ruff>=0.15.21` while CI had been installing `0.16.0`, which is why Dependabot closed #522 as redundant. `ruff`, `mypy` and `bandit` are now `==` pins (`cache: 'pip'` never mitigated this — it caches wheels, but pip still resolves to newest). The `pytest` stack stays on `>=`: it changes what runs, not what counts as a violation. A parametrized test in `tests/unit/shared/test_pinned_dependencies.py` keeps the three from silently loosening again.

### Security
- **`pypdf` 6.14.2 → 6.15.0** — PYSEC-2026-3655 and PYSEC-2026-3656, both with 6.15.0 as the published fix. `pip-audit` in the Security Scan job started failing on unchanged code once the advisories landed, so every PR into `develop` was red until this moved. The bump was already sitting in the blocked Dependabot group PR [#541](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/541) — which is the concrete cost of the mcp 2.x problem below: an un-mergeable major in a `patterns: ["*"]` group does not just delay version churn, it holds security fixes behind it. `pypdf` is used by `create_songbook.py` and `prepare_singles.py`; 6.15.0 requires Python >=3.9, so the 3.11 floor is unaffected.

### Fixed
- **A Windows drive-relative segment no longer slips through the album-path guard** ([#538](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/538)) — `_album_dir`'s lexical pass rejected a segment that was `..` or carried `/`, `\` or a null byte, which covers every shape of absolute path but one. `D:evil` holds none of those characters, so it passed — and `pathlib` then discards everything to the left of a drive, so `genre="D:evil"` returned `D:evil\al`: outside the root, with no error raised. UNC paths (`\\server\share`) were already caught, because they carry backslashes; a bare drive prefix was not. That matters because #534 passes `confine=False` at every call site except `resolve_path`, to keep symlinked album directories working — at those sites the lexical pass is the *only* guard, with no resolved check behind it to catch the escape. Not a live vulnerability, and worth saying plainly: `genre` is a real directory name and NTFS forbids `:`, `subdir` is a caller literal, the album slug is already covered (`_normalize_slug` strips `:` on Windows), and `artist` is the user's own `config.yaml` — self-harm, not an attack. It is a hole in a guarantee the helper's docstring makes and its `test_rejects_an_absolute_segment_rather_than_relativizing_it` test is named for: that test's `/etc`, `/` and `\windows` cases were all caught by the separator check, and the drive-letter form — the one shape of absolute segment that actually got through — was untested. The guard now also rejects a `PureWindowsPath(...).drive`, evaluated on every platform rather than only on Windows, so which runner sees the input does not decide whether the guarantee holds. It recognises a drive prefix (one character followed by `:`), not a colon, so `AC:DC` stays the legal POSIX directory name it always was.
  - The lexical guard is now a single `_reject_unsafe_segments` helper, and the two truncations of the same layout — `_albums_dir` and `_genre_dir` — call it too. Both interpolated their segments straight in; `_albums_dir` deliberately, on the documented grounds that `artist` is trusted config. That is true, and it is also the same component `_album_dir` guards, so which of the two helpers a caller happened to reach for decided whether the guard applied — the failure mode #529 was opened about. No call site changes behaviour, since both are reached only from config values; a bad value now returns the structured JSON error the MCP boundary produces rather than a wrong path.
  - **`PATH_ESCAPES_ROOT` now reads `Path escapes root directory`** rather than `Resolved path escapes root directory`. #534 made it the message for lexical rejections too, where nothing has been resolved, so the first word described one of the ways to trigger it and misdescribed the rest. User-visible wording only — it surfaces through the MCP error boundary, and nothing branches on the string.
- **mcp 2.x can no longer reach the plugin through Dependabot, the printed install advice, or the readiness probe** ([#537](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/537)) — `mcp` 2.0.0 restructured `mcp.server.fastmcp`'s `FastMCP` into `mcp.server.mcpserver`'s `MCPServer` and shipped no compat shim, so `server.py`'s single `from mcp` import raises and the server exits 1 before it registers a tool. `requirements.txt` pins `mcp[cli]==1.28.1`, so no correctly-installed user was ever affected — but three unpinned paths led straight to 2.x anyway:
  - **The weekly `pip-all` group PR.** Three of them ([#536](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/536), [#540](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/540), [#541](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/541)) failed Tests and MCP Server Boot on all three runners, and since the group is `patterns: ["*"]`, one un-mergeable major held every unrelated bump hostage with it — #541 was carrying ruff, pypdf, boto3 and playwright updates that had nothing to do with mcp. `.github/dependabot.yml` now ignores mcp majors, scoped to the major so 1.x patches keep flowing. It comes out together with the 2.0 migration, not before.
  - **The install advice printed by the ImportError handler itself.** Five strings across `server.py` and the server README read `mcp[cli]>=1.2.0` or a bare `pipx install mcp`, all of which resolve to 2.0.0 today. Two of them are printed *by the handler that fires when the import fails* — so someone whose server would not start followed the instructions on screen, installed the one version that cannot start, and got the same message back. A setup loop, shown precisely when the user is already stuck. All five are now bounded `<2`, with the floor moved to the version actually pinned and tested rather than the `>=1.2.0` the server has carried since the MCP server first shipped.
  - **The session-start readiness probe.** `python3 -c "import mcp"` succeeds on 2.x — the removed module is the *submodule* — so the gate `CLAUDE.md` says must halt the session reported `✅ MCP ready` on exactly the install where the server was dead, while the server's own stderr said `ERROR: MCP SDK not installed`. All four probes (`CLAUDE.md`, `skills/session-start`, `skills/setup`, `reference/workflows/error-recovery.md`) now import `mcp.server.fastmcp`, which is what `server.py` imports, and report `MCP unusable` rather than `MCP missing` — the remedy is the same `/bitwize-music:setup mcp` either way, but "missing" is wrong about a package that is installed.

  Each of the three paths is now held by a test in `tests/unit/shared/test_pinned_dependencies.py` — the dependabot ignore, the five capped install strings, and all four probe files. A fourth test asserts the SDK on the box still exposes `mcp.server.fastmcp`, and it runs in a **subprocess** on purpose: 24 test modules install a fake `mcp.server.fastmcp` into `sys.modules` when the real one is missing, so an in-process import would find the stub and pass on precisely the install the test exists to catch.

  Those 24 modules had the same false-green bug as the probes, and it made the suite undiagnosable rather than merely wrong: each gated its stub on bare `try: import mcp`, which succeeds on 2.x, so no stub was installed, `server.py` ran its real ImportError handler during collection, and its `sys.exit(1)` aborted pytest with an INTERNALERROR before a single test ran. Their guards now import the submodule too, so a 2.x install degrades to one readable failure naming the cause instead of a stack trace and `no tests ran`. The 2.0 migration itself remains open under #537.
- **The `README.md` model table no longer names pinned model versions** — 0.92.0 moved every skill's `model:` frontmatter to tier aliases (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) that auto-track the frontier model, and made pinned `claude-*` IDs a validation error, but the Multi-Model Orchestration table still advertised "Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5" — the exact form the plugin now rejects, and a claim that goes stale on someone else's release schedule. It shows the alias each tier declares instead. `reference/SKILL_INDEX.md` carried the same drift one worse — its headings named *different* stale versions ("Opus 4.6", "Sonnet 4.5"), so the two docs disagreed with each other as well as with the code, and its Haiku heading claimed 17 skills over a list of 16. Both files now name the alias; the counts are 7 / 30 / 16, summing to the 53 skills, which is what both bullet lists already contained.
- **The album directory shape is written down once, and the callers that built it by hand now get the traversal guard** — `#529` removed `tools/shared/paths.py` on the grounds that it was the *unguarded* variant of path resolution and "the obvious helper for a contributor to reach for", leaving `handlers/core.py:resolve_path` as the single implementation. That diagnosis was right, but the duplication it was meant to prevent was already there and survived the removal: `Path(root) / "artists" / artist / "albums" / genre / slug` and its two truncations appeared at fifteen sites across six handler modules. The reason is structural rather than carelessness — `resolve_path` is an `async` MCP tool that returns a JSON string, so no library code can call it, and every caller that needed a path had no option but to respell it. Only `resolve_path` applied `_normalize_slug` and a confinement check; the rest interpolated straight in, which is the same weakness `#529` deleted a file over. The guarded core is now `handlers/_shared._album_dir`, living beside `_normalize_slug` and `_is_path_confined` so the helper a caller reaches for is the one that carries the guards, with `_genre_dir`/`_albums_dir` for the two truncations callers wanted. Still one implementation — just a callable one.
  - Two guards, not one, and they are not the same guard. A **lexical** pass always runs: it rejects a `..` or separator-carrying `artist`, `genre` or `subdir` *before* the layout is rendered, and rejects an absolute segment outright rather than silently relativizing it into a confined-but-wrong path. A **resolved** confinement check (`resolved.is_relative_to(root)`) is separate, because it is not a traversal guard — it also rejects a symlinked album directory, which is a *supported* layout (`test_symlinked_audio_dir_passes`). Only `resolve_path` ever applied it, so each call site passes the `confine` value matching what it did before centralising: `True` at `resolve_path`, `False` at the sites that operate on an album directory which already exists (`_resolve_audio_dir`, `update_album_status`, `migrate_audio_layout`, `rename_album`, `validate_album_structure`). It defaults to `True` so a *new* caller who forgets fails closed and loudly.
  - **`resolve_path`'s output is unchanged except for one deliberate tightening:** a `genre` of `..` used to return `…/albums/../al`, and is now rejected with the same `Path escapes root directory` error every other escape returns. Every other input, including `genre="/etc"`, returns exactly what it did before.
  - `_album_dir` raises, so each call site catches it and reports the failure the way its own contract says: `_resolve_audio_dir` returns its `(error_json, None)` tuple rather than raising past the twenty-two call sites that branch on it; `update_album_status` adds a `release_issues` entry rather than collapsing the aggregated gate into one opaque error; and `migrate_audio_layout` records a per-album skip, so one unresolvable album cannot discard the report of files it has already physically moved into `originals/`.
- **`tracks_completed` no longer flips between two different numbers depending on which code path last ran** ([#523](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/523)) — `reference/state-schema.md` defines the field as "Number of tracks with completed status", but only the incremental track-change path counted the track files. A full rebuild (`scan_albums`) and the incremental README-changed branch both counted the album README's `## Tracklist` table instead. Since `update_track_field` rewrites a track file without touching that table, the two drifted the moment a track's status changed: `rebuild_state()` — the documented remedy for a stale cache — discarded the correct count and reinstated the README's stale one, and editing only the README silently reset it. This also made `list_albums` and `get_album_progress` disagree about the same album, and made the CLI print a README-derived numerator over an actual-file denominator (a finished album could render as `[0/12 tracks]`). All three sites now derive the count from the track files through a single `_count_completed_tracks` helper. `parse_album_readme` still reports what the README table claims, but nothing feeds it into state.
- **A corrupt `ideas` or `skills` section in state.json no longer crashes `python -m tools.state update`** ([#525](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/525)) — `incremental_update` type-guards its top-level state sections so a wrong-typed one returns `None` and the caller falls back to a full rebuild (the `#393` contract), but the guard only covered `config` and `albums`. The function also does `state['ideas'].get('file_mtime')` and `state['skills'].get('skills_root')`, so a non-mapping value in either raised `AttributeError` straight past `cmd_update`'s `is None` fallback and aborted the CLI with a traceback — the exact failure the guard exists to prevent. All four sections are now guarded; both are re-derived from disk on a rebuild, so falling back loses nothing.
- **`.gitignore` no longer lists `TESTING.md` as a build artifact** ([#526](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/526)) — the entry sat in the "Build artifacts" block between `*.egg-info/` and `.coverage`, but `TESTING.md` is a tracked contributor doc referenced from `skills/test/test-definitions.md`. The rule was inert (`.gitignore` does not affect already-tracked files) but would have silently dropped the doc for anyone who ran `git rm --cached` or re-added it after a delete.

### Removed
- **`tools/shared/paths.py` — the unused path-resolver utility** ([#524](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/524)) — the module had no production callers; its only importer anywhere in the repo was its own test file, and `git log -S` shows the sole commit ever referencing it was the one that added those tests, so it was never wired in. It also lacked the guards its live counterpart has: `handlers/core.py:resolve_path` applies `_normalize_slug` and an `is_relative_to` confinement check, while this module interpolated `artist`/`genre`/`album` straight into the path and never re-resolved, so a `..` component escaped the content root. Not exploitable — nothing called it — but it was the obvious helper for a contributor to reach for, and picking it up would have silently dropped the confinement guard. `handlers/core.py:resolve_path` covers the need; keeping one implementation is what stops the two from drifting. `tools/state/indexer.py:resolve_path` (a different, single-argument function) is unaffected.

## [0.101.0] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **MuseScore PDF-export integration test no longer flakes on windows-latest** — MuseScore 4's first launch on a clean Windows profile initializes its AppData tree (settings + crashpad `logs/dumps` dirs), and the very first CLI invocation races that init, so the export intermittently (~1 in 2) failed with a crashpad `GetFileAttributes ...\logs\dumps\attachments\...: cannot find` error. The Windows leg now warms MuseScore up once (pre-creating the crashpad dir and running a throwaway convert, tolerating failure) so the profile is initialized before the real test, with a bounded retry (3 attempts) as belt-and-braces — a persistent failure across all attempts still fails the job, so only the first-launch race is absorbed, not a real regression. Linux behaviour is unchanged (single-shot).
- **The skipped Python Floor Check nightly job now shows a readable name** — when nightly runs without a `check-python-floor` input (the cron schedule, or a plain dispatch) the floor-check job is skipped, and GitHub does not expand an empty `${{ inputs.check-python-floor }}` template on a skipped job, so the Actions run page displayed the raw template string as the job name. It now falls back to `not requested`. No behaviour change.

## [0.100.0] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **Fixed a shared-tempdir race in the transcribe cleanup test** — `test_temp_dir_cleaned_up_on_failure` globbed the system temp dir for `test-album-transcribe-*` and asserted zero, but three transcribe tests share `album_slug="test-album"`, so under `pytest -n auto` a concurrent worker's in-flight dir tripped the assertion (a false failure — same class as the #494 flake). The test now spies on `mkdtemp` and asserts on the exact path its own run created, which is immune to other workers' identically-prefixed dirs, and additionally asserts a temp dir was created (previously the assertion passed vacuously if none was). Product code is unchanged — `mkdtemp` already makes unique dirs and cleans up its own.
- **The test harness no longer relies on `PYTHONUTF8` for correct text encoding** — the product code was swept clean of encoding-less text I/O (#18 and the `hooks/` gate in #24), but the CI ruff PLW1514 (unspecified-encoding) check was scoped to `tools/ servers/ hooks/` only, so nothing enforced it in `tests/`. An audit against the gate found 36 genuine sites across 10 files — text-mode `open()`, `Path.read_text()`, `Path.write_text()`, and `NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w")` calls with no `encoding=` — that fall back to `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)`, which is UTF-8 on macOS/Linux but **cp1252** on a stock Windows box. Two of them in `test_parsers.py` write the `✅`/`❌` status glyphs through a `NamedTemporaryFile`, so on a cp1252 console those tests would raise `UnicodeEncodeError` on the write itself — green today only because CI sets `PYTHONUTF8=1` job-wide, an ambient variable the harness should not silently depend on. Every flagged site now passes `encoding="utf-8"` (binary `"rb"`/`"wb"` opens are untouched, and PLW1514 does not flag them anyway), so the harness is correct on its own. To keep the gap closed, `tests/` is added to the PLW1514 invocation in both the `Makefile` `lint` target and the CI Lint job — belt-and-suspenders, matching the product-code sweep. The plain `ruff check tools/ servers/ hooks/` invocation is deliberately left unchanged, since the repo's full ruleset is not yet clean on `tests/`. Concentration: `test_lock_backoff.py` (9), `test_parsers.py` (8), `test_indexer.py` (5), `test_config.py` and `test_server_integration.py` (3 each), `test_consistency.py`, `test_create_songbook.py`, and `test_server.py` (2 each), `test_migrations.py` and `shared/test_config.py` (1 each). Tests and tooling only — no product behavior changed.
- **macOS AAC validation silently never used afconvert** — `adm_validation._afconvert_encode_decode()` probed for afconvert with `subprocess.run(["afconvert", "--help"], check=True)`, but `afconvert --help` exits 2 on macOS (a usage convention), so `check=True` always raised `CalledProcessError` and the function fell back to the ffmpeg `aac` encoder **on every macOS machine** — the intended Apple-encoder path for inter-sample-clip validation was dead code that no one had run. Found by the new macOS afconvert CI job (below), which is exactly what it's for. The probe is now a presence check (`shutil.which("afconvert")`); the binary's `--help` exit code is irrelevant, and the real encode step already falls back on timeout / non-zero rc.
- **Clipboard is documented as working on native Windows** — it always did; the docs just said otherwise. The skill's detection chain branches on `clip.exe` and labelled that branch "WSL", which read as though native Windows were unsupported, so the compatibility matrix listed it as *unverified*. `clip.exe` is a built-in Windows utility in System32 and is reachable both from WSL via interop and from a native-Windows shell. Verified on a windows-latest runner: Git Bash is present, the chain selects the `clip.exe` branch, it resolves at `/c/Windows/system32/clip.exe`, and a copy round-trips via `Get-Clipboard`; PowerShell's `Set-Clipboard` round-trips too, giving a native fallback if a bash is ever unavailable. Labelling only — no behaviour change, and the POSIX branches are untouched.
- **Pinned dependencies and the document-hunter browser are now covered** — `playwright`, `pypdf`, `reportlab`, `mutagen` and `noisereduce` are exact pins in `requirements.txt`, but every test touching them used `pytest.importorskip`, which turns a missing or broken wheel into a *green skip* — the precise regression worth catching, silently hidden. A new test asserts each one imports, so a platform losing a wheel fails loudly (this matters most on the nightly 3.12/3.13 legs, which exist to prove wheel availability). Separately, document-hunter is a skill with no product Python, so its behaviour is not mechanically testable — but the browser it depends on is: a gated Chromium smoke test (launch headless, render a `data:` URL, assert the DOM) now runs nightly on all three OSes, since browser download and launch are the parts that differ per platform. `pip install playwright` does not install a browser, so the import check alone proved nothing about whether one was usable. Nightly rather than PR CI because Chromium is ~150MB per leg.
- **Platform docs now reflect native Windows accurately** — the compatibility matrix's overview row claimed the ffmpeg pipeline *including promo video* was "CI-tested on windows-latest". That was false: all 62 promo-video tests mock `subprocess`, so no real render is guarded on any OS — and promo video was in fact completely broken on native Windows until the filtergraph escaping fix, which is proof it was never CI-tested. Separately, none of the five per-feature tables had a **Windows (native)** column at all, so a now-supported tier was invisible in the detail. Every table gains that column with honest values (including `Untested` for Playwright and `unverified` for the clipboard skill, which is a bash snippet), promo video is marked verified-by-hand rather than continuously guarded, and the README's stale test count is corrected to 4,412.
- **Promo video now renders on Windows** — the `drawtext` filtergraph interpolated paths raw: `fontfile=` was emitted completely unquoted and `textfile=` was hand-quoted but unescaped. On Windows that produced `fontfile=C:\Windows\Fonts\arialbd.ttf`, where `:` is ffmpeg's own option separator and `\` is a filtergraph escape character — ffmpeg rejected the whole graph with `No option name near ...`, so **every promo video and album sampler clip failed on Windows**, regardless of the font fix that preceded it. Paths bound into a filtergraph now go through `escape_filter_path()`, which converts to forward slashes, escapes the colon, and single-quotes the result. The required form was established empirically on a real windows-latest runner by rendering one frame per candidate escaping — quoting alone is *not* sufficient, because the graph splits options on `:` before processing quotes. POSIX filtergraphs are unchanged apart from the added quotes (verified by a real local render).
- **Track frontmatter validation now actually runs on Windows** — `hooks/validate_track.py` decided whether a Write/Edit touched a track file with `"/tracks/" in file_path`, a forward-slash-only substring test. Claude Code hands hooks the platform's *native* path, so on Windows every path arrives backslash-separated (`C:\Users\me\…\my-album\tracks\01-opener.md`), the test was always False, `validate()` returned `[]`, and **the hook silently validated nothing on a core-tier platform** — a Windows user could save a track with a missing `title`, a missing `track_number`, or a bogus `status` like `Almost Done` and get a clean exit 0 every time, with the broken frontmatter only surfacing later as a track invisible to the state cache. This is the same silent-no-op failure class as the Python 3.9 import crash fixed in #492: that fix made the hook *run*, this one makes it do its job. Detection now folds backslashes to forward slashes and matches `tracks` as a whole path *segment*, which fixes Windows paths, UNC shares, mixed separators (`C:/foo\tracks/01-x.md` — Claude Code and user config can both produce these), and relative paths like `tracks/01-x.md` that the substring form also rejected. Segment matching preserves the one thing the old substring test got right: a directory merely *named* something containing "tracks" (`soundtracks/`, `tracksnotadir/`, `tracks-old/`) still does not match, and the `.md` requirement is unchanged. `pathlib` was deliberately not used — `PurePosixPath` does not split backslashes at all and `PureWindowsPath` behaves identically to the two-line string form while costing an import on a hook that executes on every Write/Edit in every session. The trade-off is that a POSIX file whose *name* legally contains a backslash could be split at it; the failure mode there is a harmless extra frontmatter check, not a missed one. macOS/Linux detection is otherwise unchanged.
- **Promo-video text rendering now finds a font on Windows** — `tools/shared/fonts.py` probed five hardcoded candidates, all of them Linux or macOS paths (`/usr/share/fonts/…`, `/System/Library/Fonts/…`), so `find_font()` returned `None` on every Windows host. Its three callers — `generate_promo_video`, `generate_album_sampler`, and the MCP server's video handler — feed that result to ffmpeg `drawtext`, so a Windows user's promo-video generation had no font to draw with and failed with "No suitable font found" regardless of what was installed. This was the exact hole a disarmed `if result is not None:` guard in the font tests was hiding until the inert-test sweep above armed it. Windows candidates are now appended after the POSIX list, resolved from `%SYSTEMROOT%` (falling back to `%WINDIR%`, then `C:\Windows`) rather than a hardcoded `C:`, since Windows is not always on the system drive: `arialbd.ttf`, `segoeuib.ttf`, `calibrib.ttf`, `tahomabd.ttf`, then `arial.ttf` and `segoeui.ttf` as regular-weight fallbacks. Bold-first matches the intent of the existing POSIX list (bold sans-serif is what stays legible as overlay text on video), and every listed face ships with all currently supported Windows releases, so a stock install resolves. The candidates are gated behind a `platform.system() == "Windows"` check and appended, never interleaved, so macOS/Linux discovery order is byte-identical to before.
- **The track-validation hook no longer crashes on a well-formed non-object payload** — `main()` caught only `(json.JSONDecodeError, EOFError)`, so stdin holding valid JSON that is not an object (`[1,2,3]`, `null`, `42`, `"str"`, `true`) sailed past the guard into `validate()` and died on `data.get(...)` with `AttributeError` — a traceback and a non-zero exit in the user's session. `main()` now checks the decoded payload is a `dict` and exits 0 quietly if not: there is nothing to validate, and a hook that fires on every Write/Edit must never break a session over an unexpected payload. Defence-in-depth rather than a live fix — Claude Code always sends an object today — and it retires the strict `xfail` that had been holding the bug in the suite.
- **Markdown writes no longer fail spuriously on Windows under editor/AV contention** — `atomic_write_text` (`handlers/_atomic.py`) renamed its temp file over the target with a bare `os.replace`, the same Windows failure mode #488 fixed for the state cache but never applied here. On Windows, `os.replace` over a file another process holds open raises `PermissionError` (`WinError 5` ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED / `WinError 32` ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION) — and this helper backs ~18 call sites that write *every* user-facing markdown file (album READMEs, track files, `IDEAS.md`, via `rename`, `status`, `ideas`, `core`, and the mastering stage writers). Those files are far more likely than `state.json` to be open in an editor, mid-antivirus-scan, or mid-OneDrive/Dropbox sync, so a Windows user could lose a track edit or a status update with an opaque "Access is denied" while the markdown they were looking at stayed stale. The replace is now wrapped in a bounded, Windows-only retry with semantics identical to #488 (10 attempts, ~10ms→100ms backoff, ~1s total) that retries only those two transient sharing-violation errors, then re-raises so a genuinely locked file still fails loudly rather than silently dropping the write; the existing temp-file cleanup and original-file preservation are unchanged. POSIX behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged — the rename runs exactly once.
- **Child-process output is no longer decoded with the Windows ANSI codepage** — 13 `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` call sites across the media, mastering, promotion, and sheet-music tools passed no `encoding=`, so Python decoded ffmpeg/ffprobe/afconvert/MuseScore/AnthemScore output with `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)` — UTF-8 on macOS/Linux, but **cp1252** on a stock Windows box, with *strict* error handling. Since ffmpeg echoes its input filenames back into stderr and this project explicitly supports non-ASCII track titles, a track named `Nöthing` made the failure path itself raise `UnicodeDecodeError`: the user saw a decode traceback instead of the "ffmpeg failed" diagnostic that was about to be printed. Every such call now passes `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` — `errors="replace"` matters independently of the codepage, since an external binary can emit genuinely invalid bytes and a diagnostic path must never be the thing that crashes. CI never caught this because `PYTHONUTF8=1` is set job-wide; the MCP server Claude Code launches inherits no such variable. Affected: `tools/shared/media_utils.py` (2), `tools/mastering/adm_validation.py` (4), `tools/mastering/codec_preview.py`, `tools/promotion/generate_promo_video.py`, `tools/promotion/generate_album_sampler.py`, `tools/sheet-music/transcribe.py` (2), `tools/sheet-music/prepare_singles.py` (2).
- **Windows `where` output is now parsed one match at a time** — `where` prints *one line per hit*, unlike `which`. `find_anthemscore()` returned `result.stdout.strip()` wholesale, so a user with AnthemScore in two locations (e.g. a Program Files install plus a per-user copy) got the entire CRLF-joined blob back as a single "path"; it was then passed as `argv[0]` to `subprocess.run`, failing opaquely with no hint that discovery was the culprit. `find_musescore()` already took the first line, but split on `'\n'`, which on CRLF output leaves a trailing `\r` welded to the executable path — an equally unusable path that merely fails one step later. Both now iterate `splitlines()` and return the first non-empty, stripped line, which is correct for `where`, `which`, and either line ending.
- **AnthemScore installed in its default Windows location is now found by the MCP preflight** — the server's `_check_anthemscore` fallback probed only `/Applications/…`, `/usr/bin/anthemscore`, and `/usr/local/bin/anthemscore` before falling through to `shutil.which`, while the CLI tool's `find_anthemscore()` also knows `C:\Program Files\AnthemScore\AnthemScore.exe` and the `(x86)` variant. A Windows user with a stock install that isn't on `PATH` was told "AnthemScore not found. Install from …" by the MCP transcription preflight even though the bundled CLI tool located and ran it fine. The two detectors are now at parity; macOS and Linux behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged, since a Windows drive path can never resolve there.
- **A cluster of tests that were structurally incapable of failing can now fail** — an audit found ~35 assertions across the plugin, state, and shared suites that reported green no matter what they were pointed at, so the behaviours they nominally guarded had no coverage at all. Four patterns: (1) the two skill-registration integrity checks (#234) carried a blanket `xfail(strict=False)`, which passes whether the assertion holds or not — `test_no_missing_skills_in_cache` was live-confirmed XPASSing — and they are now version-anchored, skipping only when the local plugin cache has no entry for *this* checkout's version and asserting for real when it does (this also fixes a latent bug in the ghost check, which unioned every cached version and so reported a skill deleted three releases ago as a ghost forever); (2) `TestStateCacheThreadSafety::test_concurrent_get_state` passed on the exact deadlock it targeted — `join(timeout=5)` returns silently, leaving `results` empty, and `all([])` is `True` — so it now asserts thread liveness after each join, the exact result count, and the observed state itself (a cache handing back `{}` under contention was previously indistinguishable from success); (3) eight assertions sat behind `if` guards that were false in precisely the scenario the test existed to catch — renaming `reference/suno/artist-blocklist.md` turned three artist-name tests green simultaneously, and `if result is not None` disarmed font-path validation on exactly the fontless runners where discovery is most likely broken — each guard is now an unconditional assertion with a diagnostic message; (4) ~20 `pytest.skip("… not found")` calls turned missing or unparseable *required* plugin assets (core templates, promo templates, `SKILL_INDEX.md`, `config.example.yaml`, `genre-presets.yaml`, and any skill whose YAML frontmatter fails to parse) into green skips, which on Windows would let a path/encoding failure that makes a file unreadable mask itself as a pass. Also removes four `assert … or True` / `assert True` no-ops, replacing each with the real invariant it was standing in for. Skips are retained only where the artifact is genuinely optional (the local plugin cache; a host with no system fonts). Tests only — no product behaviour changed.
- **Three wall-clock races removed from the test suite, and the `validate_track` hook covered for the first time** — the same class of defect as the windows-latest lock-stress flake below: a test standing a `time.sleep()` window in for a happens-before relation, so a loaded CI runner fails the build and blames product code. `test_adm_validation_parallel_345` proved the ADM checks run concurrently by sleeping 50 ms inside each check and asserting an observed-concurrency counter reached 2 — on a contended runner under `-n auto`, thread-pool startup can stagger past that window and the counter stays at 1; overlap is now *forced* with a `threading.Barrier(2)`, so a serial stage breaks the barrier deterministically instead of flaking (a companion test pins that failure mode by driving the real stage with its bound set to 1). `test_prune_archival` separated four files with `time.sleep(0.01)` and asserted which two survived by mtime, a bet that the filesystem resolves a 10 ms gap — it does not on Windows, where the clock feeding file times ticks at ~15 ms; mtimes are now stamped explicitly with `os.utime`. `test_indexer`'s "incremental_update does not mutate the original" slept 10 ms and asserted two ISO-8601 `generated_at` stamps differed, which coarser-granularity platforms can serialise identically; the test now freezes `indexer.datetime` to two known instants and asserts the exact values. `test_lock_backoff`'s release-then-acquire test raced a `time.sleep(0.3)` releaser against the backoff schedule *and* contained zero assertions — it passed with the function under test stubbed to `pass`; a `threading.Event` handshake now sequences the release behind an observed retry, and it asserts the contender genuinely holds the lock afterwards (a third handle is refused) and that a retry actually occurred. Separately, `hooks/validate_track.py` — a PostToolUse hook that runs on every Write/Edit under the *system* `python3` — had no tests at all despite a recent Python 3.9 import crash that silently disabled track validation; a new suite covers the validation contract (each required field, invalid status, missing frontmatter, non-track paths, content-less Edit payloads, malformed stdin, exit codes 0/2) plus a regression guard asserting the module's annotations stay lazily evaluated, so the PEP 604 crash cannot return unnoticed. Tests only; no product behavior changed.
- **CI now asserts ffmpeg is actually present instead of trusting the installer** — every ffmpeg-dependent test gates on a module-level `shutil.which("ffmpeg")` skipif (codec preview, ADM validation, mastering samples), so a half-succeeded `choco install ffmpeg` / `brew install ffmpeg`, or a shim directory that never reached the *next* step's `PATH`, would let all ~10 audio tests silently skip while the leg still reported green — quietly reversing #484's entire point of putting ffmpeg on the Windows runner. Both `test.yml` and `nightly.yml` now run an explicit `ffmpeg -version` + `ffprobe -version` verification step on all three legs immediately after the per-OS install. It runs under `shell: bash` (`-eo pipefail` on all three OSes, Git Bash on Windows) so a missing binary fails the job loudly rather than degrading into a silent skip.
- **`hooks/` is now linted** — both the `Makefile` `lint` target and the CI Lint job scoped ruff to `tools/ servers/`, leaving `hooks/` — code that auto-executes on every Write/Edit in every user session — with no lint gate at all. `hooks/` is added to both ruff invocations (the plain check and the `--select PLW1514 --preview` encoding check) in both places. This surfaced two pre-existing I001 findings that had never been checked: `hooks/validate_track.py` had an unsorted import block (`json, sys, re`) and `hooks/check_version_sync.py` had non-conforming spacing after its imports; both are fixed, with `from __future__ import annotations` kept first, immediately after the module docstring.
- **`PYTHONUTF8=1` now reaches the two jobs that need it most** — it was set on the `test` job, nightly `deep-test`, and both integration jobs, but not on `mcp-boot` (test.yml) or `mcp-e2e` (nightly.yml) — precisely the two jobs that drive a real stdio JSON-RPC handshake against a cp1252-locale Windows runner. It is now declared once at workflow level in both files so every job inherits it, with the per-job duplicates removed; behaviour for the jobs that already had it is unchanged. `wsl2-suite` is unaffected either way — job-level env does not cross the WSL boundary, so it still exports `PYTHONUTF8` inside the distro.
- **Experimental nightly legs can now report their own failure** — `deep-test` uses `continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.experimental || false }}` so a broken 3.12/3.13 leg doesn't fail the nightly run, but `continue-on-error` sets the *job result* to `success`, meaning `notify-failure`'s `if: failure()` never fired for those legs and the signal existed only for a human who opened the run page — which, for a nightly, is never. The legs still don't fail the run (deliberately), but each one now writes its true `steps.tests.outcome` to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` (leg, tier, pass/fail), so the run page shows at a glance whether an experimental Python is broken. The summary step is `if: always()` because a failed step otherwise skips the remainder of the job even under `continue-on-error`.
- **Corrected the stale Python floor in `requirements.txt`** — the install header still claimed "Required: Python 3.10+", contradicting both the README and #467, which established 3.11+ as the real floor (the MCP server imports `datetime.UTC`, a 3.11+ name) — and contradicting the file's own `scipy==1.17.1` pin, which floors at 3.11. Comment-only; no pins changed.
- **MuseScore installed as `musescore3`/`mscore3` (the standard apt package) is now detected** — `find_musescore()` only listed bare `mscore`/`musescore` on Linux and only probed those two names on `PATH`, so a plugin user who ran `apt install musescore3` (which installs `/usr/bin/mscore3` plus a `musescore3` symlink, no bare `mscore`) got "MuseScore not found" and the sheet-music PDF re-export silently fell back to copying the source PDF. The Linux path table now also lists `/usr/bin/mscore4`, `/usr/bin/musescore3`, and `/usr/bin/mscore3`, and the `PATH` fallback probes `mscore4`/`musescore4`/`mscore3`/`musescore3` in addition to the bare names. macOS/Windows tables already reference the app bundles / versioned `.exe` names by full path, so they are unchanged. A new real-MuseScore integration test (below) exercises this end-to-end against an apt install.
- **Multi-process lock stress test no longer flakes on the windows-latest CI leg** — the test (#486) predates the #489 read-path change and still documented `read_state` as one that "never raises"; its reader worker called `read_state()` bare. After #489, `read_state` deliberately *re-raises* a transient Windows sharing violation (`WinError 5`/`32`) that outlives its bounded retry budget — and under this test's pathological 4-writer burst a reader can, on ~1 run in 8, exhaust that budget on a single iteration, crashing the worker with an uncaught `PermissionError`. The reader now catches that designed re-raise (it is contention, not a torn read or corruption) and continues, with a pervasive-failure guard (`exit 14` if it hits on more than a quarter of reads) so a genuine `read_state` retry regression still fails loudly. POSIX is unaffected — `open` never faults mid-rename there, so the reader never takes this branch. Test-only; the product contract is unchanged.
- **Transient Windows contention on the state cache is no longer misclassified as corruption** (#489) — while a concurrent `write_state` was mid-`os.replace`, a reader's `open(state.json)` transiently raises `PermissionError` (`WinError 5` / `WinError 32`); `read_state` caught it under a broad `except (json.JSONDecodeError, OSError)` and treated it as *corruption* — copying the good `state.json` to a spurious `state.<ts>.corrupt` backup and returning empty `{}`, so a session silently lost its whole state view over a normal cross-process blip (two Claude sessions, an AV scan). This is the reader-side counterpart to #488, and the reason its writer-only retry didn't settle the multi-process lock stress test on the windows-latest CI leg. The read now retries the transient open with the same bounded Windows-only budget as the writer; quarantine is reserved exclusively for *genuine corruption* (malformed JSON, or JSON that decodes to the wrong shape), and any `OSError` — a surviving sharing violation, or a real permission/disk fault — re-raises instead of quarantining good state or returning `{}`. POSIX behavior is unchanged.
- **Concurrent/AV-contended state writes no longer fail spuriously on Windows** (#488) — `write_state` renamed its temp file over `state.json` with a bare `os.replace`, which on Windows raises `PermissionError` (`WinError 5` ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED / `WinError 32` ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION) whenever another process holds the target open: a lock-free `read_state`, a second Claude session, or a transient antivirus scan. POSIX rename-over-open-file is atomic and never hits this, so the multi-process lock stress test (#486) passed on POSIX but flaked on the windows-latest CI leg. The replace is now wrapped in a bounded, Windows-only retry (10 attempts, ~10ms→100ms backoff, ~1s total) that retries only those two transient sharing-violation errors — still under the write lock so no writer interleaves — then re-raises so a genuinely stuck file fails loudly. POSIX behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **`create_track` now refreshes the state cache so new tracks are immediately usable** — `create_track` wrote the track markdown to disk but never rebuilt the server's in-memory state, so `get_track`, `update_track_field`, and `list_tracks` returned "not found" for the just-created track until the user ran `rebuild_state` by hand. It now calls `_shared.cache.rebuild()` after a successful write, mirroring `create_album_structure`; a rebuild failure is logged as a non-fatal warning (the file is already written) rather than turning a successful create into an error.
- **Mastering ceiling-guard pull-down no longer crashes on Windows** (#480) — `apply_pull_down_db` fsynced its temp WAV through a handle opened `"rb"`; on Windows `os.fsync()` calls `FlushFileBuffers`, which requires write access, so every pull-down raised `OSError(EBADF)` (`CeilingGuardError: write failed ... Bad file descriptor`). The handle now opens `"rb+"` — the file already exists and nothing is truncated, so POSIX fsync semantics are unchanged.
- **Windows slug sanitization for NTFS-forbidden title characters** (#480) — `_normalize_slug` passed `<>:"|?*` straight through, so a title like `Say "Goodbye"` produced an unwritable filename (`01-say-"goodbye".md`) and track creation failed with no `created` key. These characters are now stripped from slugs on Windows only; POSIX slugs are byte-identical to before.
- **MCP server now starts on Windows** (#476) — `tools/state/indexer.py` imported the Unix-only `fcntl` module unconditionally, crashing `server.py` on import so no MCP tools loaded on Windows. State-cache locking is now platform-gated: `fcntl.flock` on Unix, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows, behind shared `_flock_nb`/`_funlock` helpers. The lock file opens in append mode ('w' truncation fails on Windows while the byte-range lock is held), locking tests are platform-neutral, and new windows-latest and macos-latest CI jobs guard the module import, the locking tests, and (macOS) that the pinned requirements install on Apple Silicon. Reported by @Memshik42.
- **MCP server now launches on Windows via `.mcp.json`** (#476) — the launch command was `${HOME}/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/python3`, which fails twice on Windows: `${HOME}` is unset there (Windows uses `USERPROFILE`, so Claude Code left the literal `${HOME}` in place) and the venv interpreter lives at `Scripts\python.exe`, not `bin/python3`. Because Claude Code has no per-OS command mechanism and no universal `python`/`python3` name exists (Windows `python3` is a Store stub; many POSIX systems lack bare `python`), the fix is a launcher pair — `servers/bitwize-music-server/mcp-launch` (POSIX shebang) and `mcp-launch.cmd` (Windows) — referenced by its extensionless name in `.mcp.json`; Claude Code runs the shell script on POSIX and resolves the `.cmd` on Windows. Validated end-to-end against real Claude Code (2.1.210) on Windows 11: the installed plugin's server reports ✓ Connected. Reported by @Memshik42.

### Added
- **The indexer CLI command layer is now covered** — the six argparse handlers in `tools/state/indexer.py` (`cmd_rebuild`, `cmd_update`, `cmd_validate`, `cmd_session`, `cmd_cleanup`, `cmd_show`) were the second-largest uncovered block in the repo (~300 statements, lines 1507-1812): every other indexer function had a unit test, but the CLI that stitches them together — the exact code a user hits when they run `python -m tools.state.indexer …` or `/bitwize-music:rebuild` — was exercised by nothing, because `main()` is coverage-excluded and no test drove the handlers it dispatches to. A new `tests/unit/state/test_indexer_cli.py` invokes each handler in-process with a constructed `argparse.Namespace` (the same pattern the handler-function unit tests already use), asserting both the return code and the real side effect: `cmd_rebuild` writes state and preserves an existing session across a full rebuild, reports slug collisions, and returns 1 when config is missing; `cmd_update` covers all four fallbacks (no state → rebuild, incompatible schema version → rebuild, invalid sections → rebuild, clean incremental) plus the collision warning; `cmd_validate` distinguishes a valid state, schema errors, and a version mismatch; `cmd_session` sets/clears fields, rejects over-length and too-many-pending-action inputs, and persists `updated_at`; `cmd_cleanup` handles the no-state, no-albums, all-present, dry-run, and real-removal paths; and `cmd_show` renders both the empty summary and a fully-populated one (albums, tracks, collisions, ideas, skills, session) in verbose and non-verbose modes. Every test drives the autouse `_isolate_state_cache` tmp cache and stubs `read_config` rather than touching the developer's real `~/.bitwize-music`, so the suite stays hermetic and xdist-safe. This lifts `indexer.py` line coverage from 72% to 96%, with the entire 1507-1812 range now covered. Tests only — no product behavior changed.
- **The macOS `afconvert` ADM-validation path is now covered — three fallback branches by unit test, real afconvert by a macOS CI job** — `adm_validation._afconvert_encode_decode()` is the product's only macOS-exclusive code path (encode WAV→AAC with Apple's `afconvert`, decode via ffmpeg, and fall back to the ffmpeg `aac` encoder on three distinct failures), and until now `grep -rn afconvert tests/` returned zero — it was invisible to CI and to mocks alike. A new unit module, `tests/unit/mastering/test_adm_validation_afconvert.py`, drives every branch deterministically by monkeypatching `adm_validation.subprocess.run` with a recording dispatcher that fakes the whole toolchain (and writes a genuine decoded WAV for the ffmpeg `pcm_f32le` decode so the trailing `sf.read` returns a real array — no ffmpeg/afconvert needed, so it runs everywhere with no gate): (1) the `afconvert --help` probe failing as absent (`FileNotFoundError`), non-zero rc (`CalledProcessError`), or hung (`TimeoutExpired`); (2) the `afconvert` encode timing out; and (3) the `afconvert` encode returning a non-zero rc. Each test asserts on the returned encoder-name string *and* spies on which binary was actually invoked — the fallback cases must show the ffmpeg `aac` encode ran and must report encoder `"aac"` (never `"afconvert"`), while the mocked-success case must show afconvert did the encode, ffmpeg only decoded, and the fallback encode never ran, reporting `"afconvert"`. The public `check_aac_intersample_clips(encoder="afconvert")` wiring is covered too, proving the fallback vs. success encoder name propagates into `encoder_used`. The teeth were verified RED/GREEN: transiently mislabelling the encode-timeout fallback's return made the timeout test fail on the encoder-name assertion, and reverting restored green. Because a mock cannot make afconvert produce a decodable m4a, the real path is proven separately by `tests/integration/test_afconvert_macos.py`: it generates a tiny real WAV via ffmpeg lavfi, runs the real `_afconvert_encode_decode`, and asserts encoder `"afconvert"` with a non-empty float32 array at the expected 44.1 kHz. It is triple-gated — `integration` marker + `skipif(not BITWIZE_INTEGRATION)` (the standard double gate every integration module carries) plus `skipif(shutil.which("afconvert") is None)`, which keys off the actual capability rather than a `sys.platform == "darwin"` proxy (mirroring the repo's existing `requires_ffmpeg` idiom and the MuseScore test's binary-presence skip) so it collect-and-skips cleanly on Linux/Windows even when the env gate is set; ffmpeg presence is guarded the same way since both fixture generation and decode need it. A new `afconvert` job in `integration.yml` runs it on `macos-latest`: afconvert is a built-in macOS binary so nothing installs it (only ffmpeg, via Homebrew), `BITWIZE_INTEGRATION=1` opens the env gate, and a diagnostic prints `which afconvert`, the `afconvert --help` output and its real exit code (the product probes with `check=True`, so a non-zero probe would wrongly force the ffmpeg fallback — surfacing that in the logs), and the ffmpeg version. The job mirrors the sibling jobs' fork-PR guard, pinned action SHAs, and 20-minute timeout.
- **The macOS `afconvert` ADM-validation path is now covered** — `_afconvert_encode_decode()` is the product's only macOS-exclusive path, and `grep -rn afconvert tests/` used to return zero. A new unit module (`tests/unit/mastering/test_adm_validation_afconvert.py`) drives every branch deterministically by monkeypatching `shutil.which` (present/absent) and `subprocess.run` with a recording dispatcher that fakes the toolchain and writes a genuine decoded WAV for the ffmpeg `pcm_f32le` step: afconvert absent → ffmpeg `aac` fallback; afconvert present but the encode times out or returns non-zero → fallback; and the success path → encoder `"afconvert"`. A regression test pins that a present afconvert is used regardless of `--help`'s exit code (the bug fixed above). The real end-to-end path is proven macOS-only by `tests/integration/test_afconvert_macos.py` (real WAV via ffmpeg lavfi → real `_afconvert_encode_decode` → assert encoder `"afconvert"`, non-empty float32 at 44.1 kHz), triple-gated (`integration` marker + `BITWIZE_INTEGRATION` + `shutil.which("afconvert")` capability check so it collect-and-skips on Linux/Windows). A new `afconvert` job in `integration.yml` runs it on `macos-latest` (afconvert is built-in; only ffmpeg is installed, via Homebrew), mirroring the sibling jobs' fork-PR guard, pinned SHAs, and timeout.
- **MuseScore PDF export is now CI-verified on native Windows** — the MuseScore integration job gained a `windows-latest` leg. Chocolatey installs MuseScore to `C:\Program Files\MuseScore 4\bin\MuseScore4.exe` (the first entry in `find_musescore()`'s Windows path table), `find_musescore()` detects it with no help, and the export path produces a real PDF — all on every PR. This closes the last native-Windows sheet-music gap that was actually testable; AnthemScore stays licensed-only (its trial exposes no CLI on any OS, and device-based activation is incompatible with ephemeral runners). The docs are updated: the compatibility matrix's sheet-music rows move from "No — use WSL2" to Yes with per-tool footnotes (MuseScore CI-verified; AnthemScore licensed and expected-to-work but not independently run on Windows).
- **Real-MuseScore PDF re-export integration test in CI** — a new `musescore` job in `integration.yml` installs the standard apt `musescore3` and runs the sheet-music export path (`prepare_singles.export_pdf`) against a real MuseScore CLI for the first time (previously mock-only), headless via `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`. The gated `tests/integration/test_musescore_export.py` (minimal MusicXML fixture → `mscore` subprocess) asserts a genuine PDF lands on disk (`%PDF` magic, non-empty) and that the product's `find_musescore()` auto-detects the apt binary. Double-gated behind the `integration` marker + `BITWIZE_INTEGRATION`, so `pytest tests/` and the 3-OS matrix collect-and-skip cleanly with no MuseScore present. Closes the last maintainer-identified test gap (real sheet-music export).
- **Real-service integration tests in CI (Postgres + SeaweedFS/S3)** — a new `integration.yml` workflow and gated `tests/integration/` suite exercise the two surfaces that were mock-only until now against actual services. The `db_*` MCP tools run against a real PostgreSQL service container (full tweet lifecycle — db_init → create → list → update → search → stats → delete — plus db_init idempotency); the cloud uploader runs against a real SeaweedFS S3 gateway (a config → `get_s3_client` → `retry_upload`/`upload_file` round-trip, verified via boto3, plus a dry-run no-op check). Both are double-gated behind the `integration` marker and a `BITWIZE_INTEGRATION` env guard, so `pytest tests/` and the 3-OS matrix collect-and-skip cleanly with no services present. Closes two maintainer-identified test gaps (real Postgres, real S3-compatible storage).
- **Generic S3-compatible endpoint support in the cloud uploader** — `cloud.s3.endpoint_url` points the `s3` provider at any S3-compatible service (SeaweedFS, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, self-hosted), not just AWS. When set, `get_s3_client` builds the boto3 client against that endpoint with path-style addressing and request checksums only when the API requires them (compatibility with gateways that lack virtual-host buckets or reject the newer `x-amz-checksum-*` trailers). AWS-native S3 (no `endpoint_url`) and Cloudflare R2 are unchanged.
- **ffmpeg-based audio processing now CI-tested on native Windows** (#484) — the Windows test leg installs ffmpeg via Chocolatey, so the ffmpeg-gated audio tests (ADM validation, codec preview, mastering samples) run on all three OSes instead of skipping on windows-latest; they passed on the first run with no product changes needed. Reverses the original support-tier decision that kept the Windows leg ffmpeg-less. Native Windows audio remains best-effort; AnthemScore/MuseScore (sheet music) stay WSL2-recommended.
- **Plugin-install smoke test in PR CI and nightly WSL2 suite** (#485) — two permanent jobs distilled from empirical capability probes. `plugin-install-smoke` (test.yml) installs the Claude Code CLI with no Claude auth and runs the documented marketplace-add + install flow against the PR's own checkout (local-path marketplace via `claude plugin marketplace add ./`), asserting the plugin lands enabled in the versioned cache with all skills and `.mcp.json` — the probes established the plugin CLI has no auth wall, so this costs ~1 minute and no secrets. `wsl2-suite` (nightly.yml) runs the full pinned install and test suite inside WSL2 (Ubuntu-24.04, Python 3.12) on windows-latest — the documented Windows support path — benchmarked by the probes at 4256 passed / 28 skipped in ~11.5 min inside WSL. Probe by-catch documented in the workflow: setting `WSL_UTF8=1` at job level breaks setup-wsl v7.0.0's WSL version detection.
- **End-to-end MCP server boot test in CI** (#476) — new `mcp-boot` matrix job (ubuntu/windows/macos) simulates a real user install: it builds the documented `~/.bitwize-music/venv` from the pinned requirements, launches the server through the same `mcp-launch`/`mcp-launch.cmd` wrapper `.mcp.json` invokes, and drives a real stdio JSON-RPC handshake (`initialize` → `notifications/initialized` → `tools/list` → `health_check`) with a stdlib-only checker (`tests/e2e/mcp_boot_check.py`). Guards against process-level startup failures like #476 that the in-process unit suite — which mocks FastMCP — cannot catch. The checker fails on any non-JSON stdout line, so a stray print that would corrupt the stdio transport is caught too.

### Changed
- **Native Windows promoted to a Full support tier** — with the last testable gap closed (MuseScore PDF export now CI-verified on windows-latest) and clipboard + promo video confirmed on real Windows runs, native Windows moves from *Core (best-effort)* to *Full* in the compatibility matrix, alongside macOS/Linux/WSL2. The full test suite runs on windows-latest, with dedicated Windows legs for the MCP stdio boot check and MuseScore export. The remaining caveats are not Windows-specific: promo video is verified by a real render rather than continuously guarded (its tests mock ffmpeg on every OS), and AnthemScore transcription needs a licensed install (its trial exposes no CLI on any platform).
- **The coverage gate now measures all three OSes and gates on their union, closing a structural blind spot** — `test.yml` ran `--cov=tools --cov=servers --cov-fail-under=75` on the ubuntu leg only, with an explicit comment that the gate was Linux-only "to avoid cross-platform variance from win32/darwin platform branches." That variance was the signal, not the noise: every `sys.platform == "win32"` and darwin branch in `tools/` and `servers/` is *unreachable* on the one OS that was doing the measuring, so neither the headline 88% nor the 75% floor said anything whatsoever about the platform-specific code — which is precisely where this project's real bugs have lived (#476's unconditional `import fcntl`, #497's missing `os.replace` retry, #480's `os.fsync` on a read-only handle and POSIX-only slug sanitization, a hardcoded `venv/bin/python3`). The most literal example: the entire Windows locking primitive in `tools/state/indexer.py` — `import msvcrt`, `_flock_nb`, `_funlock` — reported as uncovered on every green build, and no other leg measured anything at all. All three legs now collect coverage (macOS and Windows stay on `-n auto`; pytest-cov aggregates the xdist workers itself, so their runtimes are unaffected) and upload their raw data as per-OS artifacts. A new `coverage` job merges the three and enforces the gate on the combined number, raised 75 → 80 to reflect the ~88% the union actually measures while leaving headroom. Merging across OSes required a `[tool.coverage.paths]` section in `pyproject.toml` mapping the three runner layouts (`/home/runner/work/…`, `/Users/runner/work/…`, `D:\a\…`) onto one source tree; two non-obvious rules are documented there because getting either wrong makes `coverage combine` **fail silently** — it prints "Combined 3 files" and reports the Linux-only total. The job therefore verifies the merge rather than trusting it: it fails if fewer than three legs report, if any measured path was not rewritten into the checkout, or if a known win32-only sentinel line is still uncovered after combining. `make test` deliberately keeps the lower 75 floor, since a single-OS local run can never reach the combined number.
- **Concurrency groups on `test.yml` and `integration.yml`** — only `nightly.yml` had one, so rapid pushes to the same PR stacked full 3-OS test matrices plus Docker and service-container jobs on top of each other, burning runner minutes on runs whose results nobody would ever read. Both workflows now use `group: "${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}"` with `cancel-in-progress: true`, matching nightly's pattern: the newest push per ref wins and superseded runs are cancelled. Runs on different refs are unaffected.
- **Explicit `timeout-minutes` on the remaining unbounded jobs** — `validate`, `lint`, and `security` (test.yml), both jobs in `pr-target-check.yml`, and the job in `version-sync.yml` all inherited GitHub's 6-hour default, so a hung step could pin a runner for a working day before anyone noticed. Each now carries a generous but finite budget (10 min for the fast validation/gate jobs, 15 min for lint and the pip-audit security scan). Jobs that already declared a timeout are untouched.

## [0.99.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Help index completed, validator policy re-encoded** (#473) — `skills/help/SKILL.md` now lists all 53 skills (9 were missing); `tools/validate_help_completeness.py` enforces the help-comprehensive / CLAUDE.md-curated contract (CLAUDE.md references are ghost-checked, not completeness-checked), with new unit tests; contributor checklist updated to match
- **Ruff config consolidated in pyproject** (#468, #470) — deleted `ruff.toml`, which had silently shadowed the extended `[tool.ruff]` ruleset (E,F,I,UP,B,SIM,RUF at py311) since March; fixed all 52 findings the active config surfaced with zero new suppressions
- **Plugin-suite findings resolved** (#471, #472) — `allowed-tools:` frontmatter added to the last two skills missing it; `qc_tracks.py` zip encodes its equal-length invariant with `strict=True`; promotion docstrings corrected to Python 3.11+; all 141 test definitions audited against the current repo (34 retargeted, 4 dropped with audit trail)
- **Audio-path regression checks retargeted** (#474) — the two remaining pre-refactor checks now verify the guards where they actually live (CLAUDE.md pattern block; `skills/import-audio` with the `resolve_path` requirement)

## [0.98.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Root `FAQ.md`** (#466) — integration stance, commercial rights, and project basics, linked from README

### Fixed
- **Corrected the documented Python floor to 3.11+** (#467) — the MCP server imports `datetime.UTC`, a 3.11+ name, so the old "3.10+" claim was never true

## [0.97.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Suno V5.5 mid-year knowledge refresh** (#460, #461). Documented the June 2026
  stem-separation overhaul (Auto Split / Split from Mix / Advanced Split — ~100
  instruments, generative regeneration); clarified Exclude Styles as a dedicated
  Pro/Premier field vs. an inline fallback and added group-vocal suppression
  vocabulary; noted Audio Influence ~0.70–0.85 when using Voices. A new Suno
  reference CHANGELOG entry records the research sources and a "Refuted / Not
  Adopted" list of widely-circulated V5.5 prompt-grammar claims that failed
  verification (4-7-as-a-rule, four-layer templates, per-section parameterized
  tags, inline style-field negatives).

### Changed
- **Style Box descriptor gate reframed** (#460, #461). The advisory pre-generation
  gate now flags genuine synonym-pile bloat (>12 descriptors) instead of >7, and no
  longer mislabels sparse boxes as "within the 4-7 sweet spot." The old 4-7 cutoff
  was an unvetted single-source rule that fired on the majority of real
  (~10-descriptor) style boxes; guidance across `suno-engineer`, `v5-best-practices`,
  and `pre-generation-check` is reframed so 4-7 reads as a starting heuristic, not a
  Suno rule.
- **Performance Cues standardized** to a short comma-free phrase (`[Outro - chant
  fading]`); the gate detects cues by the ` - ` separator, so gate behavior is
  unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Corrected the V5 release date** in the V4→V5 migration guide (October 2024 →
  September 2025) to match the repo's own Suno Studio / v5-generation dating, and
  hedged the unverified "V5.5 honors subtle descriptors better" claim that had been
  stated as fact.

## [0.96.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Pre-generation gates now check the Style Box descriptor and Performance Cues standards** (#456).
  `run_pre_generation_gates` previously only verified the Style Box was non-empty, so it would pass a
  20-descriptor synonym-pile or all-bare `[Verse]`/`[Chorus]` tags — the exact defects the
  `suno-engineer` Quality Standards (0.95.0) tell you to fix first. Added two advisory (non-blocking
  `WARN`) gates: **Style Box Descriptor Count** (flags >7 descriptors, counted across the period- and
  comma-delimited blocks) and **Performance Cues** (flags ≥2 structure tags with no per-section cues
  like `[Verse 1 - cold, regal]`). Closes #456.

## [0.95.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Expanded Suno metatag reference coverage and suno-engineer prompt-building workflow**.
  Metatags were mentioned in the plugin but scattered and thin — `structure-tags.md` had
  only 6 delivery/mood bracket tags and was missing `[Post-Chorus]`/`[Fade In]`/`[Hook]`,
  `v5-best-practices.md`'s Sound Effects list had only 6 examples, and the Duet pattern
  existed only inside `suno-engineer/SKILL.md` with no canonical reference. More
  importantly, `suno-engineer`'s own workflow never instructed pulling mood/voice/SFX
  vocabulary from the reference docs it already links, so real generations only ever
  got bare structure tags. Added a terminology explainer (structure tags vs.
  delivery/mood bracket tags vs. Style Box descriptors vs. inline lyrical metatags) to
  `reference/suno/README.md` and `structure-tags.md`; expanded mood tags, sound effects,
  and added a Duet/Call-and-Response + Production/Vocal FX section to `voice-tags.md`;
  and updated `suno-engineer/SKILL.md`'s workflow to explicitly pull concrete
  descriptors from these references when building vocals, instruments, and Style Box
  prompts. Deliberately did not adopt invented `[Mood: X]`/`[Energy: X]` bracket syntax
  or bracket-style instrument tags from third-party guides — those contradict this
  plugin's field-tested anti-"tag soup" guidance.

### Performance
- **ADM validation runs per-track checks in parallel** (#345). The mastering
  pipeline's inter-sample clip check encodes+decodes each track via two ffmpeg
  subprocesses; running them serially dominated wall-clock time (and tripled on
  retry). The checks now run concurrently, bounded to CPU count, with identical
  results, ordering, error handling, and clip-halt behavior.

### Docs
- **Suno Song Editor workflow guide** (#237) — `reference/workflows/song-editor.md`:
  when to use section-level edits vs. regeneration vs. mix-engineer polish, each
  operation with use cases, and mastering-pipeline interaction.
- **Creative Sliders reference** (#238) — `reference/suno/creative-sliders.md`:
  per-slider behavior, genre starting ranges, interaction effects, and
  slider-vs-prompt guidance; linked from the Suno reference index.
- **Covers & Personas workflow guide** (#239) — `reference/workflows/covers-and-personas.md`
  plus optional cover-track sections in `templates/track.md`.
- **Expanded error-recovery guide** (#240) — added recovery procedures for state
  cache corruption, mastering mid-failure cleanup, malformed markdown, batch
  partial failures, config path resolution, and plugin/MCP corruption.

### Tests
- **Dedicated handler test coverage** (#236) — new `test_handlers_content.py`,
  `test_handlers_promo.py`, and `test_handlers_maintenance.py` (the last closing
  the `migrate_audio_layout` coverage gap).
- **Corrected logger scoping** (#344) in `test_config_load_failure_logs_warning`
  so it pins the actual emitting module.

### Fixed
- **Handler & CLI correctness fixes**:
  - **`check_version_sync` no longer crashes on non-UTF-8 manifests** (#394).
    Manifests are read as UTF-8 and `UnicodeDecodeError` is handled, so the
    hook degrades cleanly instead of tracebacking on a non-UTF-8 locale.
  - **Idea duplicate detection is case-insensitive** (#395), matching the
    case-insensitive readers — `"cyberpunk dreams"` is now rejected as a
    duplicate of `"Cyberpunk Dreams"` instead of creating a second entry.
  - **Rhyme-scheme analyzer groups clear rhymes correctly** (#396). The
    spelling-based tail extraction split rhyming pairs (`eyes`/`cries`,
    `times`/`rhymes`); the nucleus is now capped and vowel `y`/`i` folded so
    they share a rhyme group, without merging genuinely distinct words.
  - **`_stage_layout` survives a corrupt `LAYOUT.md`** (#399). A non-UTF-8
    layout file raised `UnicodeDecodeError` outside the stage's guard,
    aborting the master pipeline; the read is now guarded and the stage
    regenerates from defaults per its non-halting contract.
  - **`create_track` writes valid YAML for quoted titles** (#403). A title
    containing a double-quote produced malformed frontmatter (silently
    dropping fields); the frontmatter scalar is now YAML-escaped.
  - **`update_streaming_url` escapes URLs in frontmatter** (#404). A URL with
    a double-quote or backslash produced malformed YAML on the in-place edit
    path, silently dropping the URL from the state cache; it is now escaped.
  - **`find_album_path` validates before globbing** (#405). An `album_name`
    with glob metacharacters was expanded as a pattern before the guard ran;
    validation now precedes all glob use.
  - **`qc_tracks` no longer aborts the batch on one bad file** (#408). A
    corrupt WAV now yields a per-track FAIL row and the batch continues,
    instead of tearing down the run.
  - **`reference_master` batch mode excludes the reference reliably** (#409).
    The reference WAV is matched by resolved path, so an absolute `--reference`
    is no longer re-mastered as its own target.
- **Audio/DSP edge-case crashes hardened** across the mastering and mixing
  pipelines:
  - **Silent/corrupt tracks no longer poison album LUFS aggregates** (#400).
    A `-inf` LUFS reading fed `avg_lufs`/`lufs_range` in the verification and
    ceiling-guard stages, producing `-inf`/`inf` and spurious range failures.
    A shared `_finite_lufs_aggregates` helper now aggregates finite readings
    only (returning `None` when all tracks are silent), and downstream
    rounding/comparisons handle `None`.
  - **Mix analyzer survives degenerate WAVs** (#401, #402). A zero-length WAV
    crashed with an empty-array reduction; a sub-10-sample buffer produced a
    `NaN` noise floor. Both now return a clean per-file result instead.
  - **`apply_fade_out` no longer raises on sub-sample fades** (#406). A tiny
    positive duration rounded `fade_samples` to 0 and raised; it is now a
    no-op fade.
  - **`original_lufs` reports the source loudness** (#407), measured before
    processing rather than after.
  - **Envelope followers no longer divide by zero** (#410). A 0 ms attack or
    release in `gentle_compress`/`apply_transient_shaper` raised
    `ZeroDivisionError`; time constants are clamped to a small positive floor.
  - **`find_mastered_dir` skips non-directory candidates** (#411) instead of
    crashing with `NotADirectoryError` when a candidate path is a file.
  - **`find_best_segment` no longer skips the last analysis window** (#412),
    an off-by-one in the window loop bound.
- **Malformed slugs return clean JSON across every MCP tool** (#443). The
  shared `_find_album_or_error` / `_resolve_audio_dir` / `_find_track_or_error`
  helpers called `_normalize_slug` raw, and ~13 tool handlers called it
  directly, so a slug with a path separator, null byte, or `..` traversal
  raised an uncaught `ValueError` to the MCP layer — the same class #397/#442
  fixed in a handful of handlers. The three helpers now convert that
  `ValueError` into their structured error, and a single error boundary
  installed at tool registration wraps every handler so any leaked
  `ValueError` becomes a `{"error": ...}` response. Only `ValueError` is
  caught, so genuine bugs still surface; the boundary preserves each tool's
  FastMCP schema (it wraps via `functools.wraps`).
- **Songbook no longer drops the first music page of every track** (#390).
  `create_songbook` inferred `singles_have_title_pages = (manifest is not
  None)` and unconditionally skipped page 0 of each single. But
  `prepare_singles` writes `.manifest.json` even when it silently skips the
  title page (pypdf/reportlab missing, or the step raised) — so singles with
  no title page but a manifest lost their real first page (the whole track
  for a 1-page transcription) and the TOC miscounted. `prepare_singles` now
  records the actual per-track `title_page` fact in the manifest, and
  `create_songbook` trusts that flag (falling back to the prior filename
  heuristic for legacy manifests), so only genuine title pages are skipped.
- **`create_track` validates `track_number`** (#372). Non-numeric values
  (`abc`, `1a`, empty), `None`, booleans, and zero/negative numbers now
  return a structured error naming the invalid value instead of crashing
  with an unhandled `ValueError` — and `00` no longer silently creates a
  malformed `00-title.md` track. Integers and numeric strings (`7`, `"03"`)
  keep working.
- **`_update_frontmatter_block` honors its error contract** (#378). A track
  file whose frontmatter parses to a list or scalar now returns
  `(False, "Frontmatter in <path> is not a mapping (got <type>)")` per the
  documented contract instead of raising `TypeError` out of the sheet-music
  publish loop.
- **`db_sync_album` returns a JSON error on malformed slugs** (#379). Slugs
  containing path separators, null bytes, or `..` raised an uncaught
  `ValueError` to the FastMCP layer; the slug lookup is now guarded with the
  same try/except pattern every sibling `db_*` handler uses.
- **`db_create_tweet` no longer silently drops the track link** (#380). When
  `track_number > 0` but no matching track row exists, the tool inserted the
  tweet with a NULL `track_id` while echoing the requested track number as
  if it had linked. It now returns an error naming the missing track and
  album (suggesting `db_sync_album` or `track_number=0`) before any insert.
- **`analyze_tracks.py` handles WAV-less directories** (#386). Pointing the
  CLI at a directory with no WAV files crashed with a `ValueError` from an
  empty-array reduction; it now logs a clear "No tracks to analyze" error
  and exits nonzero.
- **Slug validation errors are clean JSON in three more handlers** (#397).
  `reset_mastering`, `migrate_audio_layout`, and `get_skill` let
  `_normalize_slug`'s `ValueError` escape as an opaque tool error on inputs
  like `../other`; all three now catch it and return their module's
  structured error shape.

- **`suno-engineer` now requires checking the Style Box descriptor ceiling and defaults to
  per-section Performance Cues** (follow-up to #449). #449 documented concrete vocal/instrument/SFX
  descriptors and mentioned `v5-best-practices.md`'s "4-7 descriptor sweet spot" and
  `structure-tags.md`'s Performance Cues technique, but never wired either into the
  `suno-engineer` workflow or its Quality Standards checklist as something to actually check
  before finalizing a prompt. In real album production this produced Style Boxes with 20+
  comma-separated descriptors (mostly synonym-piles like "imperious, commanding, regal, grand,
  theatrical, explosive") and Lyrics Boxes with bare `[Verse]`/`[Chorus]` tags carrying no
  delivery variation — output that repeatedly came back sounding flat and generic across
  multiple tracks on an album. Added an explicit workflow step + Quality Standards checks
  requiring: (1) Style Box trimmed to the 4-7 descriptor sweet spot before generating, and
  (2) 1-3 Performance Cues appended to every structure tag (`[Verse 1 - cold, regal]`) by
  default, moving the song's emotional arc out of the Style Box prose and into the Lyrics Box
  where it belongs. Rewriting one in-progress track's Style Box (20+ descriptors → 6) and
  adding Performance Cues to all 12 of its section tags produced a subjectively much more
  dynamic, less generic-sounding generation — the before/after difference is what prompted
  this fix.
- **`suno-engineer` guidance-consistency follow-ups** (#454, follow-up to #453). Trimmed the
  Style Prompt example to the 4-7 sweet spot (it modeled 9 descriptors); reconciled the
  emotional-arc location between `suno-engineer/SKILL.md` and `voice-tags.md` § Emotion Arc
  Mapping (baseline mood in Style Box prose, per-section variation in Performance Cues,
  cross-referenced both ways); updated `templates/track.md` to model per-section Performance
  Cues instead of bare section tags and to stop redirecting delivery notes to the Style Box;
  and clarified that Performance Cues plus the optional standalone accent share one
  ≤3-per-section budget.

## [0.94.0] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **`load_config` no longer returns non-mapping YAML that crashes every caller**
  (#389). A config file whose top level is a list or scalar (e.g. `- foo` or
  `42`) was passed through as-is, so the first `.get()` in `resolve_path`,
  `resolve_overrides_dir`, or any other consumer died with `AttributeError`.
  Non-mapping configs now log a clear error naming the file and the actual
  type, exit cleanly when `required=True`, and return the fallback otherwise.
  The indexer's own `read_config` had the same defect (feeding the CLI
  `rebuild`/`update` commands and the MCP server's state cache) and is
  hardened identically.
- **State rebuilds no longer crash on malformed config value types** (#391).
  `build_config_section` called bare `int()` on `generation.max_lyric_words`
  (ValueError/TypeError on `lots` or `[800]`, OverflowError on `.inf`) and
  concatenated `paths.content_root` as a string (TypeError on numeric values,
  first surfacing inside `resolve_path`). New `_cfg_int`/`_cfg_str`/
  `_cfg_section` guards — following the `_cfg_bool` pattern from #388 — warn
  and fall back to defaults for wrong-typed ints, path strings, section
  mappings (`paths`/`artist`/`database`/`generation`), `artist.name`, and the
  ideas file path, so CLI rebuilds and incremental updates degrade gracefully
  instead of aborting with a traceback. Blank keys (`overrides:` with no
  value) default silently as before; warnings log only the key and type,
  never raw values, so misshapen `database` sections cannot leak credentials
  into logs. A wrong-typed `logging:` section (or non-numeric
  `logging.max_size_mb`) now disables file logging with a warning instead of
  crashing MCP server startup.
- **`migrate_state` no longer crashes when `state.json` has a non-string
  version** (#393). A JSON-valid state file with `"version": 1.2` (float,
  int, null, or list) raised `AttributeError` inside version comparison.
  Non-string versions now log a warning and return `None`, triggering the
  documented full-rebuild path. Same treatment for the surrounding state
  shape: a JSON-valid non-object `state.json` is quarantined like corrupt
  JSON (backed up, rebuilt), wrong-typed `config`/`albums` sections trigger a
  full rebuild instead of crashing `incremental_update`, and a non-string
  `last_migrated_version` is dropped on rebuild and treated as untracked by
  `get_pending_migrations` instead of crashing every subsequent
  `health_check`.
- **`argument-hint` YAML frontmatter now parses as a string across all runtimes**
  (#439). Three skill files (`configure`, `next-step`, `test`) declared
  `argument-hint: [ ... ]` with an unquoted `[`, which YAML parses as a
  flow sequence (array). Claude Code tolerates this, but GitHub Copilot CLI
  silently skips such skills — they never appear in `copilot skill list`,
  with no error even at debug log level (reproduced on 1.0.64 and 1.0.68;
  the field was added in 1.0.64 and has required a string ever since).
  Bracket forms containing a colon can also crash Claude Code's TUI
  ([anthropics/claude-code#22161](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/22161)).
  Values are now wrapped in double quotes so every runtime receives a string.
- **Pronunciation gate no longer false-passes on words containing "Word"**
  (#384). The table parser skipped ANY row whose line contained the
  substring "Word", silently dropping data rows like "Wordsworth" — if
  those were the only entries, `check_pronunciation_enforcement` reported
  `all_applied: true` with the phonetic missing from the lyrics, defeating
  the pronunciation hard rule. The same parser bug lived in the BLOCKING
  Gate 3 of `run_pre_generation_gates` — both sites now share one parser
  (`_parse_pronunciation_table`) that matches the header row by its first
  cell only and separator rows by cell content rather than substring. The
  batch promo CLI also exits non-zero on per-track failures now, so
  `generate_all_promos.py`'s error detection actually fires.
- **Batch promo-video generation reports real per-track results** (#382).
  The handler globbed `*_promo.mp4` after the run and marked every file
  `success: true` — stale files from previous runs counted as fresh
  successes and per-track ffmpeg failures were invisible.
  `batch_process_album` now returns its per-track outcomes and the
  response includes `failed` / `failed_tracks`.
- **`--retries` can no longer silently skip every upload** (#385).
  `retry_upload` with a non-positive retry count never entered its
  attempt loop and reported every file as failed (even in `--dry-run`).
  It now always attempts at least once, and the CLI rejects
  `--retries < 1` with a clear argparse error.
- **IDEAS.md and status writes are crash-safe; rename failures are honest**
  (#381, #398, #383). Every mutating write in `ideas.py` (idea backlog,
  promoted-idea README injection) and the track/README status rewrites at
  the end of `master_album` used truncate-then-write `write_text` — a crash
  mid-write could leave the entire idea backlog or a source-of-truth
  markdown file empty. All now go through the existing `atomic_write_text`
  helper (temp file + fsync + atomic rename). And when `rename_album` /
  `rename_track` move files successfully but the state-cache write fails,
  they no longer report a silently-clean success with a divergent in-memory
  cache: they rebuild the cache from disk (ground truth — the files did
  move) and report `cache_rebuilt`, or degrade to an explicit `warning`
  telling you to run `rebuild_state` if the rebuild also fails.
- **`transcribe.py` album-name resolution works again** (#375). The
  documented `python3 transcribe.py <album-name>` invocation built
  `{audio_root}/{artist}/{album}` — omitting the `artists/` and
  `albums/{genre}/` segments of the mirrored layout — so it never found a
  real album and always fell through to "Source not found". It now sweeps
  genre directories under `{audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/` (literal
  comparison, no glob), warns if legacy same-name twins exist under
  multiple genres, and the "Tried:" error hint prints the correct path
  shape.
- **Genre-list cache no longer poisons on a degenerate scan**. The
  `_get_valid_genres()` cache stored whatever the first call computed —
  including an empty set from a broken or mocked plugin root — and served
  it for the life of the process, making `create_album_structure` reject
  every genre from then on (the source of an intermittent xdist test
  failure). The cache is now keyed by `PLUGIN_ROOT` and only stores
  non-empty results.
- **Codec-preview ffmpeg can no longer hang `master_album` forever** (#387).
  `render_aac_preview` ran ffmpeg with no timeout, so a wedged subprocess
  blocked the samples stage (and the whole `master_album` call)
  indefinitely. The invocation is now bounded at 120s (mirroring
  `adm_validation.py`); a timeout raises `CodecPreviewError`, which the
  samples stage already degrades to a per-track warning.
- **Quoted YAML booleans no longer invert to True** (#388). `bool("false")`
  is `True` in Python, so quoting a falsy boolean anywhere in user YAML
  silently enabled the feature the user disabled: `mastering.
  adm_validation_enabled: "false"` in config.yaml (or album frontmatter — the
  only path that enables ADM since #353) turned Apple Digital Masters
  validation ON, `archival_enabled: "no"` enabled archival output,
  `database.enabled: "false"` still opened Postgres connections,
  `cloud.public_read: "false"` uploaded files with a **public-read ACL**,
  quoted `cloud.enabled`/`logging.enabled`/`sheet_music.section_headers`/
  `require_suno_link_for_final`/`require_source_path_for_documentary`
  flipped their gates, and a track or album `explicit: "false"` frontmatter
  flag marked the content explicit. Shared `parse_yaml_bool()` /
  `coerce_yaml_bool()` helpers (tools/shared/config.py) now parse YAML 1.1
  boolean literals (`true/false/yes/no/on/off/1/0`, case-insensitive) at
  every user-YAML boolean site; unrecognized values fall back to the key's
  documented default with a warning instead of silently meaning True. State
  schema bumps 1.3.0 → 1.4.0 with a migration that re-coerces cached
  `explicit` flags stored as strings by the old parsers.
- **Album slug collisions across genres no longer silently erase an album from
  the state cache** (#392). The indexer keyed the cache's `albums` map by bare
  directory name, ignoring the genre path segment — two albums with the same
  slug under different genres overwrote each other, so one album (and all its
  tracks) vanished from every MCP tool, and `create_album_structure` only
  checked the genre-scoped path, so it happily created the twin. Album slugs
  are now globally unique across genres: `create_album_structure` (and
  `promote_idea`, which inherits the guard) and `rename_album` reject a slug
  that already exists under any other genre, naming the existing genre/path
  and suggesting a different name or `/bitwize-music:rename`. Pre-existing
  on-disk collisions are detected at index time instead of silently
  overwriting — the lexicographically-first genre wins deterministically, and
  the shadowed album(s) are recorded in a new `album_collisions` state field
  (schema 1.2.0 → 1.3.0; migration seeds `[]`) and surfaced by `health_check`,
  `find_album`, `list_albums`, `rebuild_state`, and the indexer CLI with the
  fix guidance (rename or move the directory, then rebuild).

### Docs
- **Suno vocal-age control troubleshooting** (`reference/suno/tips-and-tricks.md`).
  Vague age adjectives ("mature and deep") in the Style Box are weak signals
  that get outcompeted by breathy/soft-coded words ("intimate", "whispered")
  sitting nearby, so Suno keeps generating a young-sounding vocal even when
  age is explicitly requested. Documents the escalation path found in
  production: concrete vocal-range/texture tags (`alto`, `contralto`,
  `smoky`, `weathered`) first, then — if a fresh generation still skews
  young — inline lyrical metatags per section (`[Verse 1: Raspy older female
  vocal, husky contralto]`) plus dropping youth-coded genre words like "pop"
  in favor of inherently mature-vocal-coded genres ("torch song", "vintage
  soul", "cabaret"), with Persona/Voice cloning (Pro/Premier) as the final
  fallback.
- **Suno generic-vocal troubleshooting** (`reference/suno/tips-and-tricks.md`).
  A related but distinct failure mode: Style Box text using emotion/character
  words ("powerful and defiant", "sultry") instead of concrete vocal
  range/texture tags produces a technically correct but generic, characterless
  voice, since Suno has no reliable mapping from mood words to timbre. Fix
  mirrors the vocal-age entry — swap or supplement emotion words with range
  (`mezzo-soprano`, `contralto`) and texture (`gritty`, `raspy`, `commanding`)
  tags, plus an explicit `no generic or polished studio pop vocal` exclude.

## [0.93.0] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Album README title guarded against null/non-string frontmatter** (#417).
  State indexing no longer errors when an album's `title` frontmatter is
  missing or not a string.
- **Batch of default and common-path fixes** (#416, closing #370/#373/#374/#376).
- **Promo clip color validation** (#415). Auto-extracted sampler colors are
  converted to `#`-prefixed hex so generated promo clips pass validation.
- **Plugin migration notes now actually surface on upgrade** (#320). The
  session-start migration check (Step 4.5) compared state's `plugin_version`
  against the manifest, but `build_state`/`incremental_update` overwrote
  `plugin_version` with the installed version on every rebuild — so "stored <
  current" could never be true and migrations were silently skipped for every
  upgrading user. Worse, no code actually parsed or surfaced migrations; Step
  4.5 was prose with nothing behind it. Fixed by separating
  `last_migrated_version` (only advanced on explicit acknowledgment, preserved
  across rebuilds) from `plugin_version` (installed version, for display), and
  adding two MCP tools: `get_pending_migrations` (computes the notes between
  `last_migrated_version` and the installed version, already parsed and sorted)
  and `acknowledge_migrations` (records them as processed). A pre-tracking
  state (`last_migrated_version` null) now surfaces the full backlog once
  instead of silently skipping it; a fresh install is seeded to the installed
  version so it sees nothing. No schema-version bump — bumping would force the
  live MCP path to auto-rebuild every existing state and erase the "behind"
  status the fix depends on. `acknowledge_migrations` also refuses to record a
  null version (e.g. when plugin.json is unreadable and no version is supplied),
  which would otherwise reset `last_migrated_version` and resurface the entire
  backlog on the next session.
- **`analyze_audio` no longer emits invalid JSON for silent tracks** (#371). A
  fully/near-silent WAV made `analyze_track` return `-inf` LUFS (and `nan`
  dynamic range), which poisoned `avg_lufs`/`lufs_range` and serialized as the
  invalid tokens `Infinity`/`-Infinity`/`NaN` — rejected by strict parsers (JS
  `JSON.parse`, the MCP client), so the whole album response failed to parse.
  Fixed at two layers: `_safe_json` now sanitizes non-finite floats to `null`
  (protects every MCP tool, mirroring `JSON.stringify(Infinity) === "null"`),
  and `analyze_audio` computes its summary over finite LUFS only, reporting
  silent tracks in a new `summary.silent_tracks` field plus a recommendation
  instead of a nonsensical "Average LUFS is -inf".

### Changed
- Dependency maintenance: held scipy/numpy at the Python 3.11 ceiling with
  3.11-safe bumps, plus routine pip and GitHub Actions group bumps (#425,
  #423, #420, #414, #413).

### Docs
- **Corrected the plugin install identifier across docs** (#426, #427). The
  install command is `/plugin install bitwize-music@bitwize-music` — the
  marketplace name comes from `marketplace.json`, not the repo name — fixed in
  the README, the `test-definitions.md` consistency test, and the
  `troubleshooting.md` skill-files path. Thanks @DaveMatNat.

## [0.92.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Skills now use model tier aliases** (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) in `model:`
  frontmatter instead of pinned IDs. Aliases auto-track the frontier model of each
  tier, so new Claude releases (e.g. Opus 4.8) are picked up with no file edits (#365).
- **Added per-skill `effort:` levels** on Opus/Sonnet skills — `max` for core
  creative work (lyric writing/refinement/review, album concept), `high`/`medium`/
  `low` by task. Haiku skills omit `effort:` (unsupported on that tier) (#366).
- **Removed the `skill-model-updater` skill and the `Claude Model Updater` CI
  workflow** (`.github/workflows/model-updater.yml`; 53 skills total, down from 54).
  Their per-release version-bumping job is obsolete under aliases, and the
  alias/effort hygiene they would have audited is now enforced by the test suite —
  with the model-alias format additionally checked by the Static Validation CI job.
- The `model:` field is now **alias-only** — pinned `claude-*` IDs are rejected by
  both the test suite and the Static Validation workflow, so the convention can't
  silently regress.
- Updated `model-strategy.md`, `SKILL_INDEX.md`, `docs/skills.md`, the skill test
  suite, and the commit co-author convention to reflect aliases, effort, and Opus 4.8.

## [0.91.0] - 2026-05-08

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **ADM validation is now per-album opt-in via README frontmatter**
  (issue #353). Prior behavior: `mastering.adm_validation_enabled:
  true` in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` would run ADM on every
  album. New behavior: the album's own README must include
  `mastering: { adm_validation_enabled: true }` in its frontmatter.
  Global `config.yaml` value is ignored for this key.

  Context: a significant chunk of mid-April 2026 went into building
  out the ADM pipeline — dark-casualty classification, per-track
  ceiling tightening, harmonic excitation in polish, warn-fallback
  sidecars, observability instrumentation (#347, #348, #349, #350,
  #351, #352) — only to discover at the end that ADM (Apple Digital
  Masters inter-sample peak validation) is an Apple-submission-tier
  niche that almost never matters for Suno-generated tracks. Suno
  output typically lacks the high-mid spectral content ADM requires,
  so most tracks ship dark-casualty-flagged regardless of how much
  the pipeline works at them.

  Rather than rip out the ADM infrastructure — the work has real
  value for the minority of albums that ARE submission-viable, and
  much of the underlying machinery (warn-fallback contract,
  per-track ceiling architecture, spectral regression guard) pays
  off on normal mastering too — it stays enabled per-album via
  frontmatter opt-in and defaults OFF for everyone else. No more
  silent 3-5 min/track overhead on runs that can't pass anyway.

  Operators who want ADM per album add `mastering: {
  adm_validation_enabled: true }` to the album's README
  frontmatter. Global `config.yaml` value is ignored for this
  key — it's the kind of decision that should live with the
  album, not with the operator's memory.

### Added
- Per-album `mastering:` frontmatter block. Currently accepts
  `adm_validation_enabled`; future keys (ceiling_db, target_lufs,
  archival_enabled) will use the same block with standard
  frontmatter > config > default cascade.
- Harmonic excitation in polish — `apply_harmonic_excitation`
  DSP primitive + per-stem `excitation_db` preset setting.
  When `defaults.analyzer.adm_aware_excitation: true` in the
  mix preset, dark-classified stems (high_mid band_energy < 10 %)
  get synthetic upper-harmonic content added during polish via
  tanh saturation → high-pass → attenuate → mix. Gives
  mastering's limiter room to work on dark Suno material that
  would otherwise ship with ADM inter-sample peak flags. Off by
  default — enable per preset when targeting ADM compliance.
- Post-QC spectral regression guard — WARN when mastering pushed a
  track's `tinniness_ratio` (high_mid/mid) above 0.6 AND the ratio
  grew by more than +0.10 from pre-master. Preset-tunable via
  `post_qc_tinniness_warn_floor` and `post_qc_tinniness_warn_delta`.
  Flags the regressed track(s) in `ctx.stages["post_qc"]
  ["tinniness_regressions"]` and in `ctx.warnings`.
- `fix_dynamic` iterates up to 3 times to reach target LUFS,
  returning `converged` and `iterations_run` in metrics.
- `_stage_verification` emits `VERIFICATION_WARNINGS.md` sidecar and
  downgrades to `status: "warn"` when auto-recovery exhausts
  iterations. Pipeline continues instead of halting.
- **`/bitwize-music:promote-idea` skill + `promote_idea` MCP tool (#328)**: One-shot conversion of a `Pending` idea from `IDEAS.md` into a full album project. Auto-derives the album slug from the idea title (lowercase, ASCII-only, diacritics stripped, apostrophes elided, non-alphanumeric → hyphen) or accepts an explicit override. Calls `create_album_structure` with the idea's genre, injects the idea's `**Concept**` text into the new album `README.md` under a `## Concept` section, advances idea status `Pending → In Progress`, and adds a `**Promoted To**: <slug>` back-link in `IDEAS.md`. Distinct errors for missing idea, already-promoted idea, missing/invalid genre, and duplicate album slug. `documentary=True` flag mirrors `new-album` behavior (creates `RESEARCH.md` + `SOURCES.md`). The state indexer now also extracts `concept` and `promoted_to` fields from `IDEAS.md` so downstream tools can read the concept without re-parsing the markdown.
- **Genre-aware silence QC thresholds**: new `silence_leading_max_s` / `silence_trailing_max_s` preset fields (`tools/mastering/genre-presets.yaml`). Defaults 0.5 / 3.0 s. `electronic` and `edm` override `silence_leading_max_s: 1.5` so filter-sweep / build intros don't FAIL the silence gate. (#323 comment)
- **Click removal on every stem polish chain**: `vocals`, `backing_vocals`, `bass`, `synth`, `guitar`, `keyboard`, `strings`, `brass`, `woodwinds`, `other` now run click removal as the first step (was drums / percussion only). Shared `_apply_click_removal` helper standardizes the detector across all chains — `click_peak_ratio: 15.0` default matches the analyzer in `analyze_mix_issues` so polish and analysis report the same events. Genre presets (e.g. `electronic: 10.0`) overlay the default per-genre. Drum / percussion chains kept `cubic` repair (better spectral reconstruction on isolated transients); harmonic stems use `linear` repair (safer on dense mix content and vocal consonants). `mix_track_stems` dispatch unified — every processor now accepts `report` and surfaces `clicks_removed`. (#323 comment)
- `ctx.track_ceilings`, `ctx.dark_tracks`, `ctx.remaster_filenames`
  on `MasterAlbumCtx` — per-track ADM tightening state.
- `is_dark` field on `analyze_track` output (`band_energy['high_mid']
  < 10 %`).
- `ADM_VALIDATION.md` sidecar now includes `dark_casualties`,
  `tightened_tracks`, and per-track final `track_ceilings` in the
  adm_validation stage output.

### Changed
- **Opus skills migrated from 4.6 to 4.7** (#319). Bumped `model:`
  frontmatter on the seven Opus-tier skills: `album-conceptualizer`,
  `lyric-refiner`, `lyric-reviewer`, `lyric-writer`, `researchers-legal`,
  `researchers-verifier`, `suno-engineer`. Co-author line in `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/SECURITY.md`, and `.github/pull_request_template.md`
  updated to `Claude Opus 4.7`. Docstring example in `tools/state/parsers.py`
  and schema example in `reference/state-schema.md` updated to use the
  current model ID. Sonnet/Haiku skills were already on current versions
  and required no changes. CI skill-frontmatter regex already admits 4.7
  IDs. No fixed thinking budgets exist in the repo, so 4.7's
  adaptive-thinking-only constraint is a no-op here.
- `master_album` docstring enumerates halt vs warn-fallback
  conditions explicitly.
- **Logger names standardized to `__name__` (#268)**: All 12 MCP server modules that used `logging.getLogger("bitwize-music-state")` now use `logging.getLogger(__name__)`, giving hierarchical logger names (e.g., `handlers.processing.audio`) so operators can filter logs by module/subpackage. Affected: `server.py`, `handlers/{core,database,gates,maintenance,text_analysis}.py`, `handlers/processing/{audio,video,mixing,sheet_music,_album_stages,_helpers}.py`. Six `caplog` assertions in the test suite updated to reference the new module-hierarchical logger names.
- **Dense-transient genre click QC thresholds bumped** to match `idm`'s calibration (`click_peak_ratio: 10.0`, `click_fail_count: 30`, was 8.0/15). Applies to `electronic`, `edm`, `techno`, `drum-and-bass`, `jungle`, `dubstep`, `hardstyle`, `breakbeat`, `metal`, `industrial`, `trap`, `drill`, `phonk`, `grime`, `shoegaze`, `dream-pop`. Prior values were flagging post-polish electronic drum transients as clicks (20+ clicks on a 3-min track → FAIL) even though the hits are musical, not digital pops. (#323 comment)
- **`polish_album` verify stage** now runs a pre-master check subset (`format, mono, phase, clipping, silence, spectral`) and defers `truepeak` / `clicks` to post-mastering QC. Polished audio is un-limited and dense-transient (the limiter is what enforces the ceiling), so failing those checks on pre-master files is a false gate. The stage surfaces `checks_run` and `checks_deferred_to_post_master` for transparency. (#323 comment)
- **`master_album` pre-QC stage** now forwards `genre` to `qc_track` (so genre-preset silence / click thresholds apply) and surfaces `checks_run` / `checks_deferred_to_post_master` in its status output. (#323 comment)
- ADM ceiling tightening is now per-track. A single clipping track
  no longer drags the album-wide ceiling down; clean tracks keep
  their original ceiling regardless of neighbor ADM failures.
- `_stage_mastering` honors `ctx.remaster_filenames` — on ADM retry
  cycles, only clipping non-dark tracks are re-mastered.
- Dark tracks (high_mid band_energy < 10 %) are excluded from ADM
  tightening; their ADM clips route to warn-fallback instead of
  forcing further ceiling reductions.

### Fixed
- **Analyzer recommendations never reached polish** (root cause of
  "9/10 dark_casualty" on Suno albums despite enabling
  `adm_aware_excitation`). `analyze_mix_issues` keyed per-stem
  analyses by raw WAV filename stem (`01-Vocals`, `lead_vocals`, …)
  while `mix_track_stems` looked them up by canonical `STEM_NAMES`
  category (`vocals`, `drums`, …) from `discover_stems`. Keys
  never matched → `stem_recs = {}` → `overrides_applied: []` →
  excitation (and every other analyzer rec) was silently dropped.
  Bonus bug: `_analyze_one`'s
  `MIX_PRESETS["defaults"][stem_name]["excitation_db_when_dark"]`
  lookup also failed for the same reason, falling back to a
  hardcoded 2.0 for every stem regardless of type. Fix: analyzer
  now uses `discover_stems` to canonicalize before storing
  results, matching what polish looks up.
- ADM warn-fallback reporting was inaccurate when the loop
  short-circuited on the all-dark first check:
  - Warning text hardcoded `_ADM_MAX_CYCLES` (the configured max)
    instead of the actual executed count. Now reports
    `adm_cycles_executed` + `adm_tightening_cycles` separately and
    uses different wording when no tightening ran.
  - `ADM_VALIDATION.md` advice contradicted the pipeline verdict —
    recommended "Tighten true-peak ceiling by 0.5 dB and re-master"
    even when every failure was a dark-content casualty. The
    renderer now takes a `dark_casualty_filenames` kwarg and tailors
    the advice: all-dark failures get harmonic-excitation guidance,
    partial failures split advice by track class.
  - `per_track_decisions` dict on `adm_validation` stage output —
    records classification (`dark_casualty` / `tightenable`),
    outcome (`not_tightened` / `diverged` / `floor_reached` /
    `tightened`), reason, cycle, and final ceiling per clipping
    track. Survives the all-dark short-circuit path where
    `adm_history` and `track_ceilings` are both empty.
- Auto-recovery path now writes at `output_sample_rate` (was using
  source rate, so 48 kHz polished sources produced mastered files
  at 48 kHz while the rest of the album was 96 kHz).
- `master_album` halting at `verification` when track-level auto-recovery
  couldn't converge. The docstring promised warn-fallback; the
  implementation now delivers it.
- **`master_album` status_update stage no longer brittle on re-masters (#335)**: The stage previously only promoted tracks from `Generated → Final` and appended a "Skipped: expected Generated" error for any other starting status. Combined with a hardcoded `status: "pass"` report this silently no-op'd the entire stage on any re-master of an album whose tracks weren't pinned at exactly `Generated` (Not Started, Sources Pending, Sources Verified, In Progress, Released — all hit this). The stage now promotes any non-terminal status (`Not Started`, `Sources Pending`, `Sources Verified`, `In Progress`, `Generated`) to `Final` because the mastered WAV is real and status should follow. `Final` and `Released` are left alone as terminal states; `Released` specifically is never demoted back to `Final` on a re-master. Tracks with an empty `path` (cache-staleness, no disk file) are now silently skipped instead of appending an error. Stage outcome is now classified honestly: `pass` when clean or idempotent, `partial` when some updates succeeded and some errors exist, `skipped` when nothing updated AND errors exist (was always `pass` before, masking real failures).
- **`/bitwize-music:lyric-refiner` no longer blocks on instrumental-mixed albums (#311)**: The refiner's former guard clause — "Track status `Not Started` or `Sources Pending` → error" — fired on any non-ready vocal track and stopped the whole run, even when other tracks were refineable. Replaced with a three-bucket triage (instrumental / not-ready / refineable): non-refineable tracks are silently skipped with a one-line note (`Skipping {track} — instrumental` or `Skipping {track} — no lyrics yet ({status})`), and the refiner processes whatever is left. Zero-refineable is now a clean informational exit, not a guard-clause failure. Added explicit `### Instrumental Guard` section to match the convention shared with `lyric-writer` / `lyric-reviewer` / `pronunciation-specialist`, and extended the `TestInstrumentalGuard.test_instrumental_guard_section` parametrize to cover `lyric-refiner`. Report header now shows both skip counters: `X of Y (Z instrumental skipped, W Not Started skipped)`.
- **qc_audio silence check (#321)**: Trailing silence followed by a sub-threshold noise-floor blip no longer gets misclassified as an internal gap. The silence detector now classifies each silent region by position AND by the amount of non-silent content between the region and the file edge — a region ending within 1s of the file end (with <300ms of non-silent content after it) counts as trailing, not internal. Unblocks the `master_album` / `polish_album` pre-QC gate on tracks with natural fade-outs.
- **analyze_mix_issues click detection (#323)**: Replaced the sample-wise `|diff| > 6·σ(diff)` detector with a windowed peak-to-RMS check (matches `qc_tracks._check_clicks`) at `peak_ratio=15` over 10 ms windows. The old detector flagged tens of thousands of "clicks" on every clean vocal, bass, and synth stem (vocal consonants and synth attacks have high instantaneous derivatives but spread their energy across a window), emitting `click_removal: true` recommendations that the polish pipeline silently ignored. The analyzer now only recommends click removal when genuine single-sample discontinuities exist.

## [0.90.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **opus_safe TP override (#290)**: `opus_safe: true` preset field applies -1.5 dBTP ceiling for dense-transient genres (EDM, trap, metal, dubstep, drum-and-bass, hardstyle, industrial, punk).
- **ADM validation stage (#290 step 9)**: `master_album` now runs `_stage_adm_validation` after ceiling guard — encodes each mastered WAV to AAC (ffmpeg native `aac` default; afconvert on macOS; `libfdk_aac` via config override), decodes back, checks for inter-sample peaks. Emits `ADM_VALIDATION.md` sidecar. Halts if clips found.
- **ID3v2.4 metadata embedding (#290)**: `master_album` embeds artist, album, title, copyright, and label into mastered WAV delivery files via `tools/mastering/metadata.py`. ISRC and UPC fields are supported by the tool but not yet sourced in the pipeline (follow-up).
- **polish_audio per-stem WAVs (#290)**: Stems mode now writes `polished/<track>/vocals.wav` (and other processed stems) alongside the full mix, activating stem-first vocal-RMS measurement in the mastering analysis.
- **Album-ceiling guard (#290 phase 5, step 8)**: `master_album` now gates
  mastered tracks against `album_median + 2 LU`. Small overshoots (≤0.5 LU)
  get a silent scalar pull-down; larger overshoots halt + escalate.
- **LAYOUT.md emitter (#290 phase 5, step 7)**: `master_album` writes
  `LAYOUT.md` next to `ALBUM_SIGNATURE.yaml` with one transition per
  adjacent track pair. Album-level override via
  `layout.default_transition: gapless` in README frontmatter.
- **Album coherence check + correct (issue #290 phase 3b)** — Two new MCP tools. `album_coherence_check` measures the mastered album, selects an anchor, and classifies every other track against per-genre tolerance bands: LUFS (±0.5 LU), STL-95 (`coherence_stl_95_lu`, default ±0.5 LU), LRA floor (`coherence_lra_floor_lu`, default 1.0 LU minimum), low-RMS (`coherence_low_rms_db`, default ±2.0 dB), vocal-RMS (`coherence_vocal_rms_db`, default ±2.0 dB). Read-only — returns per-track violation lists + a summary with outlier counts broken down by metric. `album_coherence_correct` takes the same check output and re-masters LUFS-outlier tracks from `polished/` into `mastered/` (atomic staging pattern, mirrors `master_album`) with the per-track `target_lufs` overridden to the anchor's **measured** LUFS — chasing real output rather than an idealized preset target guarantees convergence. Supports `dry_run=True` for CI preview. MVP scope: LUFS correction only; STL-95 / LRA / RMS outliers are reported but not auto-corrected (compression-ratio correction comes in a later phase). Four new tolerance fields added to the `defaults:` block in `genre-presets.yaml` (and `_PRESET_DEFAULTS` in `master_tracks.py`).
- **Album signature measurement (issue #290 phase 3a)** — New `measure_album_signature` MCP tool. Runs `analyze_track` on every WAV in an album's subfolder (default `mastered/`), then aggregates into per-track signature metrics (LUFS, peak, STL-95, short-term range, low-RMS, vocal-RMS, 7-band spectral energy) plus album-level aggregates (median, p95, min, max, range, eligible-count). When `genre` or `anchor_track` is supplied, also runs the phase-2 anchor selector and surfaces per-track deltas from the anchor. Read-only — no files written. Intended for tuning genre tolerance presets from reference albums and for feeding the phase-3b coherence check/correct tools. New pure-Python module `tools/mastering/album_signature.py` holds the aggregation + delta math (no I/O, no MCP coupling).
- **Mastering foundation — streaming-grade 24/96 delivery (issue #290 phase 1a, #304)** — New `mastering:` block in `config.example.yaml` documenting streaming-grade defaults (24-bit WAV at 96 kHz, -14 LUFS, -1 dBTP). `master_audio` and `master_album` now consume these defaults via a new `tools/mastering/config.py` loader (`load_mastering_config`, `resolve_mastering_targets`) with precedence: explicit handler arg > genre preset > user config > hardcoded default. Mastering report emits a runtime honesty notice when the resolved `delivery_sample_rate` exceeds the probed source rate ("upsampled from 44.1 kHz source — no additional audio information vs. source"). New opt-in archival output path writes 32-bit float pre-downconvert copies to `{audio_dir}/archival/` when `mastering.archival_enabled: true`; new `prune_archival` MCP tool keeps the N most-recent archival files per album. Optional new config keys `artist.copyright_holder`, `artist.label`, `mastering.adm_aac_encoder` (default `aac`) for downstream metadata embedding and ADM validation phases. `qc_tracks.py` format check expanded to accept 44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192 kHz (was 44.1/48 only). Companion issue #303 tracks the full-fidelity metadata embedding story.
- **Realistic audio test fixtures + integration tests** — Added `make_clicks_and_pops`, `make_silent_gaps`, and `make_phase_partial` generators to `tests/fixtures/audio/` for QC paths a sine wave can't exercise (injected DC pops, internal silent gaps, partial phase cancellation). Audio fixtures moved from an unscanned `tests/fixtures/audio/conftest.py` into `tests/conftest.py` so all tests auto-discover them. New `tests/unit/mastering/test_integration_realistic_audio.py` exercises sibilance/tinniness, partial-phase mono fold FAIL, click detection, internal-gap silence FAIL, and LUFS spread across dynamic content. Documented generator catalog and authoring conventions in `tests/fixtures/README.md` (#300)
- **Mastering samples — codec preview + mono fold-down QC artifacts** — `master_album` now writes operator-listening artifacts to a sibling `mastering_samples/` directory after verification, so `mastered/` stays byte-identical to the streaming upload. Each track gets a 128 kbps `.aac.m4a` AAC encode (Bluetooth-path audition), a `.mono.wav` mono fold sample (phone-speaker / Echo audition), and a `.MONO_FOLD.md` per-band delta report. A >6 dB band drop in the mono fold hard-fails the pipeline with the offending frequency surfaced (phase cancellation guard). New standalone tools `render_codec_preview` and `mono_fold_check` run the same checks independently. Thresholds and on/off flags configurable in `genre-presets.yaml` defaults; `reset_mastering` accepts `mastering_samples` (#296)
- **Mastering pipeline overhaul** — 30+ new configurable parameters across the full mastering chain:
  - DC offset removal (subsonic HPF)
  - Low shelf EQ with configurable Q factor
  - Linear-phase FIR EQ option (zero phase distortion)
  - Mid/side EQ for frequency-selective stereo management
  - De-essing with frequency, bandwidth, threshold, and ratio controls
  - Stereo width adjustment with bass mono fold
  - Parallel compression (wet/dry blend) with makeup gain
  - 3-band multiband compression with Linkwitz-Riley crossovers
  - Iterative LRA (Loudness Range) targeting per EBU R128
  - Look-ahead limiting with configurable release
  - Oversampled processing for nonlinear stages (2x/4x)
  - Sample rate conversion
  - 24-bit output support
  - Inter-track gap insertion
  - Album-level loudness consistency (two-pass mastering)
  - Extended loudness metering (short-term, momentary LUFS)
- **Mix pipeline enhancements** — saturation, sub-bass exciter, transient shaping wired into per-stem processing
- **Configurable mastering presets** — refactored from tuples to dicts; all parameters exposed via CLI and genre presets
- **Album signature persistence (#290 phase 4):** `master_album` now writes `ALBUM_SIGNATURE.yaml` alongside `mastered/` after every successful run, capturing the anchor, album medians, delivery targets (LUFS, TP ceiling, LRA), and coherence tolerances. Released albums automatically enter "frozen mode" on re-master — the shipped anchor + targets are reused so subsequent masters don't drift from what's on DSPs.
- **`freeze_signature` / `new_anchor` params on `master_album`** — force frozen or fresh routing regardless of album status. Mutually exclusive; enforced in pre-flight.
- **`is_album_released` helper** in `handlers/_shared.py` for cache-backed status checks.
- **`get_plugin_version` helper** in `handlers/_shared.py` — single source of truth for plugin version reads (DRYed from health.py and master_album's new stage).
- **`reference/streaming-mastering-specs.md`** — new authoritative reference for delivery targets, the signature contract, and re-mastering behavior.

### Changed
- **Stage extraction refactor (#290 D5)**: `master_album` is now a ~60-line orchestrator delegating to 14 standalone stage functions in `handlers/processing/_album_stages.py`. Zero behavior change; enables ADM validation (step 9) to land cleanly.
- **Default mastered output format** — `master_album` / `master_audio` / `polish_and_master_album` now produce **24-bit WAV at 96 kHz** by default (was 16-bit at source rate, typically 44.1 kHz). Existing user configs without a `mastering:` block pick up the new defaults on the next run. To preserve the legacy 16/44.1 output, set `mastering.delivery_bit_depth: 16` and `mastering.delivery_sample_rate: 44100` in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml`. Users with custom `{overrides}/mastering-presets.yaml` per-genre values continue to honor those overrides. Disk usage increases ~3x per track at the new defaults (~33 MB vs. ~10 MB for a 3-minute stereo track).

### Fixed
- **Notices on early-exit paths (A4 #290)**: Failure JSON from `master_album` now always includes the `notices` key, even when the pipeline halts before successful completion.
- LRA targeting now iteratively adjusts compression ratio (was measurement-only)
- Added missing `--deess-bandwidth` CLI arg
- Added missing CLI args for multiband ratios/thresholds and mid/side frequencies
- Wired `eq_low_q` through to `apply_low_shelf()` (was defined but unused)
- Look-ahead limiter now hits its target ceiling exactly (was overshooting by ~1 dB on transients). Gain at peak samples was being sampled from the release-relaxed envelope; replaced with a rolling minimum over the lookahead window (#283)
- QC click detector is now genre-aware: `click_peak_ratio` and `click_fail_count` are per-genre preset fields, tuned looser for genres with intentional sharp transients (electronic, IDM, breakcore, trap, metal, glitch, footwork, etc.) so musical transients no longer FAIL QC. `qc_tracks.py` accepts `--genre`, the `qc_audio` MCP tool accepts `genre`, and user `mastering-presets.yaml` overrides still apply (#285)
- Mastering chain now adds a final true-peak guard at the output rate after downsample and SRC. `scipy.signal.resample_poly`'s polyphase FIR has passband ripple that previously reintroduced 0.1–0.9 dB inter-sample peaks above the limiter ceiling; one reactive `limit_peaks()` pass closes that gap so `ceiling_db` is hit within ~0.05 dB without the prior headroom workaround (#286)
- Polish-stage declicker now reads `click_peak_ratio` / `click_fail_count` from
  the mastering genre preset so polish and QC click detection stay aligned.
  Stem passes (drums, percussion) use cubic-spline repair across ±1.5 ms of
  clean neighbors instead of two-sample linear interpolation; full-mix fallback
  keeps linear repair because dense mix content amplifies surgical artifacts.
  Polish results now surface `clicks_removed` per stem and on the full-mix
  result so operators can see whether polish acted (#289).
- `analyze_mix_issues` in stems mode now analyzes every stem per track and reports per-stem diagnostics under `tracks[].stems[stem_name]`, rather than sampling only the alphabetically first stem. Issues in specific stems (muddy bass, harsh vocals, etc.) are no longer missed, and per-track issue rollups are the union across stems (#272)
- **Archival stage now mirrors `mastered/` (#290 phase 4, PR #304 review A5):** orphans whose basename is no longer in `mastered/` are pruned before new files are written, so re-masters with fewer or renamed tracks don't retain stale archival entries. Records pruned names under `stages.archival.pruned`.

## [0.80.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Modularized MCP server** — broke monolithic `server.py` (10,260 lines, 76 tools) into 16 focused handler modules under `handlers/`, reducing `server.py` to ~480 lines of orchestration ([#85](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/85), closes [#81](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/81))
- **`_find_track_or_error` shared helper** — deduplicated track lookup boilerplate across 8 call sites in 5 handler modules

### Fixed
- **State cache stale after `create_album_structure`** — new albums are now immediately available to subsequent tools like `create_track`
- **Shadowed `import re as _re`** in processing.py and _shared.py — now uses module-level `re`
- **19 unused imports** removed across handler modules (F401 lint violations from monolith extraction)
- **Duplicated constants** — `_STREAMING_PLACEHOLDER_MARKERS`, `_MARKDOWN_LINK_RE`, and `_CODE_BLOCK_SECTIONS` deduplicated into `_shared.py`

### Changed
- **Album sampler clip generation** refactored to delegate to `generate_waveform_video()` from promo video module, eliminating duplicated filter code and ensuring consistent rendering (contributed by [@markus-michalski](https://github.com/markus-michalski) in [#76](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/76))

## [0.75.0] - 2026-03-23

## [0.67.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Sheet music URL persistence** — `publish_sheet_music` now writes uploaded R2 URLs back to track and album frontmatter automatically (singles → `sheet_music.pdf`/`musicxml`/`midi` per track, songbook → `sheet_music.songbook` on album README)
- **`prepare_singles.py`** — replaces `fix_titles.py`; copies source files to `singles/` with clean consumer-ready titles, generates `.manifest.json` for track ordering
- **Songbook title page, TOC, and footers** — `create_songbook.py` enhanced with professional title page, table of contents, and configurable footer URL

## [0.66.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **12-stem pipeline** — expanded from 6 to 12 stem types matching Suno's full `split_stem` output: guitar, keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion now have dedicated processing chains instead of being dumped into the "other" catch-all
- **Instrument-name keywords** — flexible stem routing matches by instrument name (e.g. "Piano.wav" → keyboard, "Saxophone.wav" → woodwinds, "Trumpet.wav" → brass, "Violin.wav" → strings)
- **Genre overrides for new stems** — 20+ genre presets updated with per-stem settings for guitar, keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion
- **45 new tests** — 6 processor test classes, 12-stem integration test, 6 keyword routing regression tests

### Fixed
- **Percussion/drums separation** — "percussion" keyword no longer routes to "drums"; Suno separates kit drums (kick/snare/hi-hats) from percussion (congas/shakers/tambourine) and they need different processing chains

## [0.65.0] - 2026-02-22

### Reverted
- **`originals/` audio layout** — reverted `originals/` subdirectory layout and `migrate_audio_layout` MCP tool; WAV files remain in album audio root

- **`reset_mastering` MCP tool** — removes `mastered/` and/or `polished/` subfolders so the mastering pipeline can be re-run cleanly; dry-run safe by default, `originals/` and `stems/` are protected
- **`cleanup_legacy_venvs` MCP tool** — detects and removes stale per-tool venvs (`mastering-env`, `promotion-env`, `cloud-env`) left over from pre-0.40.0; dry-run safe by default
- **Dev mode docs** — CONTRIBUTING.md section explaining how to avoid cached plugin conflicts when using `--plugin-dir`

### Removed
- **Redundant requirements files** — removed `requirements-mastering.txt`, `requirements-mixing.txt`, `requirements-promo.txt`, `requirements-research.txt`, `requirements-sheet-music.txt`, and `tools/cloud/requirements.txt`; the unified `requirements.txt` covers all dependencies

### Fixed
- **Stale venv references** — updated `config/README.md`, `TESTING.md`, `reference/mastering/mastering-workflow.md`, and `skills/test/test-definitions.md` to reference unified `venv/` instead of legacy `mastering-env/`
- **Migration 0.40.0** — added missing `cloud-env` cleanup action
- **CI installs full dependencies** — `test.yml` now uses `requirements.txt` instead of the removed `requirements-mastering.txt`

### Changed
- **Documentation sanitized** — replaced real album names with generic examples across 19 files

## [0.33.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Pronunciation Table Enforcement rule** — every entry in a track's Pronunciation Notes table must be applied as phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics. The table is a checklist of required substitutions, not documentation. Added full process, verification format, common failures, and anti-pattern examples to lyric-writer SKILL.md. Added to quality check #3 and pitfalls checklist.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-02-01

## [0.30.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **No Invented Contractions rule** — Suno only handles standard pronoun/auxiliary contractions (they'd, wouldn't). Invented forms (signal'd, TV'd, network'd) will mispronounce or skip. Added to Pronunciation section, quality check #3, and pitfalls checklist.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Density/pacing reframed as Suno verse length limits** — replaced abstract syllable-density metrics with practical line counts per verse by genre and BPM. All 67 genre READMEs updated to `Density/pacing (Suno)` with default lines/verse, max safe limits, and BPM-aware guidance.
- **New BPM-aware fallback table** — universal verse length limits when genre README doesn't specify (4 lines at <80 BPM, 6 at 94-110, 6-8 at 110-140)
- **Default 4 lines/verse** unless genre and tempo justify more — shifted from permissive 8-line defaults to conservative 4-line baseline
- **Red flag: 8-line verse at BPM under 100** — now flagged as too dense for Suno
- **Streaming lyrics exception** documented — distributor text can have longer blocks but breaks must match Suno structure

## [0.28.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Genre-specific lyric density/pacing norms** — all 67 genre READMEs now include density character, syllables/line range, max topics/verse, typical BPM, and genre-specific pacing notes under Lyric Conventions
- **Chorus lead-in rule** — the line before a chorus must not duplicate the chorus hook, phrase, or rhyme word. Prevents flat chorus entries.
- **Quality checks expanded to 12** — #10 density/pacing (genre-aware), #11 chorus lead-in, #12 pitfalls checklist
- **4 new pitfalls checklist items** — verse too dense for BPM, too many proper nouns per verse, density mismatch with Musical Direction, chorus lead-in repeats chorus

### Changed
- **Lyric density architecture**: Genre READMEs now own density/pacing norms. SKILL.md keeps universal rules + quick-reference table by genre family.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Lessons Learned Protocol** — 5-step process for turning production issues into preventive rules. When technical issues are discovered (pronunciation errors, rhyme violations, formatting problems), fix immediately, sweep the album, draft a rule, present to user, and log the lesson.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Strict homograph handling for Suno pronunciation** — "context is clear" is never acceptable for homographs. Hard process: identify, ASK user (never guess), fix with phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics only, document in track pronunciation table.
- **Full homograph table** — live, read, lead, wound, close, bass, tear, wind with both pronunciations and phonetic spellings

## [0.25.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Genre-specific lyric conventions for all 67 genres** — research-backed rhyme schemes, verse structures, rhyme quality expectations, key rules, and anti-patterns added to every genre README under a new "Lyric Conventions" section
- **Genre-aware quality checks** — rhyme scheme check (#8) and flow check (#9) now verify conventions match the genre instead of enforcing hip-hop couplets universally
- **Quick-reference rhyme table in lyric-writer** — compact summary of all genre families' default schemes, replacing 190 lines of inlined genre tables with a pointer to genre READMEs

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Genre READMEs now own lyric conventions (rhyme, structure, rules). Lyric-writer SKILL.md keeps universal craft rules + quick-reference table.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Section length guardrails by genre** — per-section line limits for 12 genre families (all 67 genres) to prevent Suno from rushing, compressing, or skipping lyrics. Covers Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, Punk, Metal, Country/Folk, Electronic, Ambient, R&B, Jazz, Reggae, and Ballad.
- **Section length enforcement rules** — hard limits that must be trimmed before presenting drafts (hip-hop verse max 8 lines, any chorus max 6 lines, electronic verse max 6 lines, punk kept tight)
- **Section length added to quality checks** — now check #7 in both lyric-writer Automatic Quality Check and CLAUDE.md master workflow, plus added to Lyric Pitfalls Checklist

## [0.23.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Song length guidance for lyric writer** — word count targets by genre (150–250 pop, 200–350 rock/folk, 300–500 hip-hop), default structure (2 verses + chorus + bridge), and hard limits to prevent 800+ word songs that cause Suno to rush or skip sections
- **Length check added to lyric reviewer** — 9-point checklist (was 8-point) now includes word count validation with warning/critical severity levels
- **Suno best practices updated** — "Keep Lyrics Concise" note in Lyric Formatting section explaining shorter lyrics generate better results

## [0.22.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **3 documentary/storytelling hip-hop deep-dives** — focused on narrative architecture, political documentary craft, and storytelling technique:
  - **Kendrick Lamar** — concept album mastery, vocal personas, jazz-funk-West Coast fusion, nonlinear timelines (GKMC, TPAB, DAMN., GNX)
  - **Run the Jewels** — El-P/Killer Mike dual-MC interplay, industrial political hip-hop, humor + protest balance (RTJ1-4)
  - **Immortal Technique** — politically charged documentary rap, "Dance with the Devil" narrative craft, fierce independence
- Hip-hop genre INDEX.md and README.md updated with all 3 artists

### Fixed
- **Removed artist/person names from Suno prompt keywords** in Ben Folds deep-dives — replaced "Ben Folds Five style", "Ben Folds solo style", "Ben Folds style", "Paul Buckmaster strings", "Nick Hornby storytelling", and "yMusic chamber rock" with descriptive style keywords (both deep-dive files and piano-rock INDEX.md)

## [0.21.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **46 artist deep-dives** across 11 genres — comprehensive reference files (265-554 lines each) with overview, members, discography, musical analysis, Suno prompt keywords, and reference tracks:

- **Genre README updates** — Deep Dive and Keywords links added to artist tables across all 11 genres; Garth Brooks added to country README

## [0.21.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Artist reference indexes** — New `genres/[genre]/artists/INDEX.md` files for punk (127 lines) and piano-rock (84 lines) providing extracted Suno prompt keywords and reference tracks without loading full deep-dives (~2,900 lines across 6 files)
- **Lazy-loading guidance in CLAUDE.md** — New rule: read `artists/INDEX.md` first for Suno keywords; only read full deep-dive when detailed history/analysis is needed

### Changed
- **Genre README Artists tables** — Deep Dive column now includes `[Keywords]` shortcut links to INDEX.md alongside existing deep-dive links (punk, piano-rock)
- **CLAUDE.md directory structure** — Added `INDEX.md` to both plugin and content directory trees; updated deep-dive creation rule to require INDEX.md updates

## [0.20.1] - 2026-01-30

### Changed
- **README** — Added Claude Code Max plan ($200/month) recommendation callout for new users

## [0.20.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Python logging module** across all 15 tool files — `tools/shared/logging_config.py` with `ColorFormatter` (TTY-aware colored output via `Colors` class) and `setup_logging()`. Errors/warnings/status go to stderr via `logger`, formatted tables and data summaries stay as `print()`. `--verbose`/`--quiet` CLI flags added where argparse exists.
- **Progress indicators** — `tools/shared/progress.py` with `ProgressBar` class (TTY-aware █/░ bar). Added to 7 batch-processing tools: `master_tracks.py`, `analyze_tracks.py`, `reference_master.py`, `upload_to_cloud.py`, `generate_promo_video.py`, `generate_album_sampler.py`, `transcribe.py`.
- **Retry logic for cloud uploads** — `retry_upload()` in `upload_to_cloud.py` with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s), `--retries` CLI arg (default: 3). Retries on `ClientError` (except 403/404), `ConnectionError`, `Timeout`.
- **Concurrent processing** — `-j`/`--jobs` CLI arg in 4 tools: `master_tracks.py` and `analyze_tracks.py` (`ProcessPoolExecutor`), `transcribe.py` and `generate_promo_video.py` (`ThreadPoolExecutor`). Default: 1 (sequential), 0 = auto (CPU count).
- **State cache cleanup command** — `python tools/state/indexer.py cleanup` removes albums from cache whose paths no longer exist on disk. Supports `--dry-run`.
- **New shared modules** — `tools/shared/logging_config.py`, `tools/shared/progress.py`, `tools/shared/__init__.py`
- **Test coverage improvements** — 180 tests (up from 137), 91% coverage. New test files: `test_logging_config.py` (13 tests), `test_progress.py` (14 tests). New test classes in `test_indexer.py`: `TestCmdCleanup`, `TestCmdRebuild`, `TestCmdValidate`, `TestCmdShow`, `TestCmdUpdate`. Edge case tests added to `test_parsers.py`.
- **Dev tooling** — `requirements-test.txt` (pytest, pyyaml, ruff, pytest-cov), `ruff.toml` config, CI workflow updated with test and lint jobs

## [0.19.3] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- **Venv-first messaging** across all tools and skills — error messages in `upload_to_cloud.py` and `generate_promo_video.py` now show venv setup commands instead of bare `pip install`. Cloud-uploader and promo-director SKILL.md docs updated to present venv as the primary (not alternative) approach.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Cloud upload album discovery** in `upload_to_cloud.py` — added recursive glob fallback when standard flat path (`{audio_root}/{artist}/{album}`) doesn't exist. Handles audio directories that mirror the content structure with genre folders (e.g., `artists/bitwize/albums/rock/shell-no/`). Reports all checked paths on failure.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Cloud upload path resolution** in `upload_to_cloud.py` — when `--audio-root` override already includes the artist path, the script no longer doubles it (e.g., `.../bitwize/albums/rock/bitwize/shell-no`). Now tries standard path first, then falls back to direct `{override}/{album}` lookup.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Per-feature requirements files** - Install only what you need:
  - `requirements-mastering.txt` - Audio mastering (matchering, pyloudnorm, scipy, numpy, soundfile)
  - `requirements-promo.txt` - Promo videos (pillow, librosa)
  - `requirements-sheet-music.txt` - Sheet music (pypdf, reportlab, pyyaml)
  - `requirements.txt` - Cloud uploads (boto3)
  - `requirements-research.txt` - Document hunting (playwright)
- **Model tier consistency test** in `run_tests.py` - Validates SKILL.md model assignments match model-strategy.md, reports tier distribution, detects `disable-model-invocation` flags
- **Cross-references** added to reference docs (v5-best-practices, distribution, pronunciation-guide, checkpoint-scripts) linking related skills and docs
- **Task-oriented guide table** in `reference/suno/README.md` - "When to Use Which Guide" quick lookup

### Fixed
- **Security: ffmpeg command injection** in `generate_promo_video.py` - Switched from `text=` (injectable via title/artist strings) to `textfile=` parameter with temp files
- **Silent audio crash** in `master_tracks.py` - Added guards for `-inf` LUFS from silent/near-silent audio, skips instead of crashing
- **Case-insensitive WAV discovery** in `master_tracks.py` - Now finds `.WAV` and `.wav` files
- **PIL file handle leak** in `generate_promo_video.py` - `Image.open()` now uses `with` block
- **Shallow copy bug** in `indexer.py` - `existing_state.copy()` replaced with `copy.deepcopy()` to prevent nested dict mutation
- **Race conditions** in `indexer.py` - Added `try/except OSError` around 4 `stat()` calls where files could be deleted between glob and stat
- **Whitespace in Suno Link parsing** in `parsers.py` - Added `.strip()` and en-dash to exclusion list
- **Sources Verified false positive** in `parsers.py` - Reordered matching to check "pending" before "verified", preventing "NOT verified" matching as verified
- **Model tier test substring matching** in `run_tests.py` - Used exact `### heading` regex instead of substring match (prevented "about" matching in prose, "researcher" matching "researchers-legal")

### Changed
- **SKILL_INDEX.md** realigned all 38 skills with model-strategy.md (added missing Opus/Sonnet skills, corrected tier assignments)
- **Album template** (`templates/album.md`) - Replaced hardcoded artist text with generic guidance, renamed distributor heading
- Removed `disable-model-invocation: true` from `release-director` and `skill-model-updater` skills
- Test runner timeout now configurable via `BITWIZE_TEST_TIMEOUT` env var (default: 60s)
- Removed redundant `import re` in `run_tests.py`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-01-29

- **State test category** in test runner (`/bitwize-music:test state`)
  - Validates state tool files exist
  - Checks schema version constant
  - Runs parser unit tests as subprocess

### Changed
- Session Start in CLAUDE.md now uses state cache instead of scanning markdown files
  - Reduces startup from 50-220 file reads to 2-3 file reads
  - Falls back to full rebuild if cache missing, corrupted, or schema changed
  - Shows last session context (album, phase, pending actions)
- Resume skill now reads from state cache instead of glob + individual file reads
  - Reduces per-invocation from 15-50 file reads to 1-2 file reads
  - Updates session context via `indexer.py session` command
  - Includes optional staleness check with incremental update
- CLAUDE.md "Finding Albums" section now references state cache as primary lookup before Glob fallback
- CLAUDE.md "Resuming Work" section updated to describe state cache workflow
- CLAUDE.md Session Start step 2 uses full `python3 {plugin_root}/tools/state/indexer.py` paths consistently

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `indexer.py` now runnable as `python3 tools/state/indexer.py` (was failing with `ModuleNotFoundError`)
  - Added `sys.path` fixup at top of file (same pattern as test files)
  - CLAUDE.md and resume SKILL.md both documented the broken form
- `documents_root` default now derives from `content_root` instead of CWD
  - `audio_root` default also derives from `content_root`
  - Prevents wrong paths when running from a different directory
- Tracklist parser now handles variable column counts (3+ columns)
  - Previously required exactly 5 columns; silently returned 0 tracks if template changed
  - Extracts track number (first col), title (second col), status (last col)
  - Emits warning if Tracklist section exists but no rows matched
- `state.session` was dead code — no write mechanism existed
  - Added `session` CLI command to `indexer.py`
  - Resume skill step 5 now calls `indexer.py session` to persist context

  - Scripts check both album directory and parent directory
  - Clear error messages when artwork not found

### Fixed

## [0.12.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed mastering-engineer skill to run scripts from plugin directory instead of copying them to audio folders
  - Scripts now use dynamic plugin path finding (version-independent)
  - Uses `find` command to locate latest plugin version automatically
  - Scripts invoked with audio path as argument instead of cd-ing to audio folder
  - Removed all instructions to copy scripts (cp command)
  - Added "Important: Script Location" section with CRITICAL warning
  - Added Common Mistakes section with 5 error patterns:
    - Don't copy scripts to audio folders
    - Don't hardcode plugin version number
    - Don't run scripts without path argument
    - Don't forget to activate venv
    - Don't use wrong path for mastered verification
  - Updated "Per-Album Session" workflow to use dynamic paths
  - Added regression test to prevent recurrence

**Root cause**: Previous documentation implied scripts lived in audio folder by saying "navigate to folder, run python3 analyze_tracks.py", causing Claude to copy scripts first. Plugin version numbers in cache path (0.12.0, 0.13.0, etc.) meant hardcoded paths would break after updates.

**Impact**: Audio folders now stay clean (only audio files), scripts always use latest version, plugin updates don't break mastering workflow.
