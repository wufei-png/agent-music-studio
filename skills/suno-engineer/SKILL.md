## Your Task

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

When invoked with a track file:
1. Read the track file
2. **Check if instrumental**: Look for `instrumental: true` in frontmatter or `**Instrumental** | Yes` in Track Details
3. Find album context: extract album directory from track path (`dirname $(dirname $TRACK_PATH)`), read that directory's README.md for album-level genre/theme/style. If README missing, use only track-level context.
4. Construct the style prompt and fill the Generation Settings table (model, Variety, Max Mode — see § Generation Settings)
5. Update the track file's Suno Inputs section

**For instrumental tracks** (no lyric-writer prerequisite):
- Set `Instrumental: On` in Suno settings
- Style Box: Focus on genre, instrumentation, mood, tempo — no vocal description needed
- Lyrics Box: Use structural section tags only (`[Intro]`, `[Main Theme]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`, `[End]`) — no sung lyrics
- Skip Streaming Lyrics, Pronunciation Notes, and Phonetic Review sections
- This skill is the **entry point** for instrumental tracks (they skip lyric-writer entirely)

When invoked with a concept:
1. Design complete Suno prompting strategy
2. Provide style prompt, structure tags, and recommended settings

## Core Principles

### Suno is Literal
The current models follow instructions closely. Don't overthink it.
- Simple, clear prompts work best
- Say what you want directly
- Trust the model to understand

**Suno's models are the v6 family** (v6, v6-wild, v6-mini, Custom Models). The prompt surface: 1,000-char style box, 5,000-char lyrics box, 1,000-char Exclude Styles, the same structure tags and sliders — but two controls decide whether your prompt is even used as written: **Variety** (set **Off**, or Suno rewrites the Style Box) and **Max Mode** (2× credits; On for tracks over ~2:00, covers and Voices). Work in **Advanced Mode only** — Simple Mode expands supplied lyrics and hosts the multimodal features the plugin doesn't use. Model choice: [models.md](../../reference/suno/models.md); full detail: [best-practices.md § The Current Models](../../reference/suno/best-practices.md#the-current-models). When using **Voices**, drop gender/register descriptors from the style box; when using a **Custom Model**, drop generic production language.

### Section Tags are Critical
Structure your songs with explicit section markers:
- `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`, `[End]` — see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/structure-tags.md` for the full set (including `[Post-Chorus]`, `[Break]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Fade In]`/`[Fade Out]`)
- Suno uses these to shape arrangement
- Without tags, structure can be unpredictable
- **Default, not optional — Performance Cues**: append a brief delivery-cue phrase (a word or two) directly to each structure tag (`[Verse 1 - cold regal]`, `[Bridge - raw breaking]`) — see the same reference's "Performance Cues" section. This is how an emotional arc is carried across a song. Leaving every section as a bare `[Verse]`/`[Chorus]` with no cues is a common, easy-to-miss cause of flat, generic-sounding output — do this for every track, not just ones that seem to need it.
- **Optional accent**: a standalone delivery/mood bracket tag (`[Whispered]`, `[Aggressive]`, etc.) can additionally color performance — see the same reference's "Custom Mood/Style Tags". Use sparingly, and count it against the **same ≤3-per-section budget** as the Performance Cues above (cues + accent ≤ 3 bracketed descriptors per section — more than 3 causes noise). This is not a substitute for Style Box mood/energy prose.

### Vocals First
In Style Prompt, put vocal description FIRST:
- ✓ "Male baritone, gritty, emotional. Heavy rock, distorted guitars"
- ✗ "Heavy rock, distorted guitars. Male baritone vocals"

## Override Support

Check for custom Suno preferences:

### Loading Override
1. Call `load_override("suno-preferences.md")` — returns override content if found (auto-resolves path from config). **Why:** user-specific genre mappings (e.g. "dark-electronic" → specific Suno genres) and avoidance rules outrank base genre knowledge and must be in context before the style prompt is constructed.
2. If found: read and incorporate preferences
3. If not found: use base Suno knowledge only

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/suno-preferences.md`:**
```markdown
# Suno Preferences

## Genre Mappings
| My Genre | Suno Genres |
|----------|-------------|
| dark-electronic | dark techno, industrial, ebm |
| chill-beats | lo-fi hip hop, chillhop, jazzhop |

## Default Settings
- Instrumental: false
- Model: v6
- Variety: Off
- Always include: atmospheric, moody

## Avoid
- Never use: happy, upbeat, cheerful
- Avoid genres: country, bluegrass, folk
```

### How to Use Override
1. Load at invocation start
2. Check for genre mappings when generating style prompts
3. Apply default settings and avoidance rules
4. Override mappings take precedence over base genre knowledge

**Example:**
- User requests: "dark-electronic"
- Override mapping: "dark techno, industrial, ebm"
- Result: Style prompt includes those specific Suno genres

## Prompt Structure

### Lyrics Box Warning

**CRITICAL: Suno literally sings EVERYTHING in the lyrics box.**

❌ **NEVER put these in the lyrics box:**
- `(Machine-gun snare, guitars explode)` - will be sung as words
- `(Instrumental break)` - will be sung as words
- `(Verse 1)` - will be sung as words
- Stage directions, production notes, parenthetical descriptions

✅ **Only put actual lyrics and section tags:**
- `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]` - these are section TAGS, not sung
- Actual words you want sung

**For instrumental sections, use:**
- `[Instrumental]` or `[Break]` - section tag only, no parentheticals
- `[Guitar Solo]` or `[Drum Break]` - descriptive section tags

### Lyrics Box Format
```
[Intro]

[Verse]
First line of lyrics here
Second line of lyrics here

[Chorus]
Chorus lyrics here

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
```

**Rules**:
- Use section tags for every section
- Section tags only for instrumental parts (no parentheticals — Suno sings them)
- Clean lyrics only (no vocalist names, no extra instructions)
- Phonetic spelling for pronunciation issues

### Style Prompt (Style of Music Box)

**Structure**: `[Vocal description]. [Genre/instrumentation]. [Production notes]`

**Example**:
```
Male baritone, storytelling delivery. Alternative rock, clean electric guitar,
driving bass, tight drums. Modern production.
```

**Before finalizing, review the descriptor mix across all three blocks** — the box is delimited by periods *and* commas (`[Vocal]. [Genre]. [Production]`). The target isn't a magic number: **every descriptor should add distinct information** (vocal identity, genre, tempo, 2-3 instruments, a production note). A focused ~10-descriptor box is fine — what dilutes Suno is a *synonym-pile*: stacking "imperious, commanding, regal, grand, theatrical, explosive" is one mood said six ways, not six descriptors. Collapse synonyms to 1-2 words per concept, but don't strip genuinely distinct detail just to hit a count (4-7 is a starting heuristic, not a Suno rule; the advisory gate only flags real bloat above ~12 — see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/best-practices.md` § Keep It Simple). Keep the baseline mood/energy here, but move **section-by-section** variation into Performance Cues in the Lyrics Box instead of piling on adjectives — that's where a per-section arc belongs. (An alternative arc technique — mapping sections in Style-Box "Performance:" prose — lives in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/voice-tags.md` § Emotion Arc Mapping; use one approach per track, not both.)

### Exclude Styles (Negative Prompting)

Exclusions **shift the odds** against an element — probabilistic, not a hard filter, and can't override a prompt that strongly implies the thing you're excluding.

**Where they go:**
- **Pro/Premier** → Suno's dedicated **Exclude Styles** field (Custom Mode → Advanced Options). The reliable path.
- **Inline `no [element]` in the Style Box does not work on v6** — a launch-week test saw "no drums" ignored (The Verge). Use the Exclude Styles field; on a plan without it, restructure the prompt to not imply the element instead.

**Rules:**
- **Max 2–4 items** — over-specification dilutes the effect
- **Bare elements, never "no"**: `drums`, `electric guitar`, `autotune`. The field is the negation; `no drums` in it is redundant at best, and if the value ever lands in the Style Box it asks *for* drums
- **Suppressing unwanted group vocals** (a common Suno over-add): `choir`, `crowd vocals`, `backing vocals`, `gang vocals`, `call-and-response`, `vocal harmonies`, `layered vocals` — still probabilistic; pair with a leaner style prompt
- **Always record them in the track file's Exclude Styles section, even when none apply** — write `### Exclude Styles` followed by `(none)` so downstream tools can confirm the field was considered, not silently skipped. Most tracks land here.

**Auto-populate guidance:** Consider whether genre/instrumentation context implies exclusions:
- Acoustic folk → `electric instruments, drums`
- A cappella → `instruments`
- Lo-fi chill → `aggressive vocals`

Only add exclusions when there is a clear reason.

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/best-practices.md` § Negative Prompting for full details.

### Generation Settings

Fill the track's `### Generation Settings` table (Advanced Mode → More Options). Defaults are in `templates/track.md`; the catalog is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/models.md`.

| Setting | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `v6` for finished tracks. `v6-wild` for a first pass on an undecided sound, or on the genres where v6 is reported weak or generic — grunge, metal, alt-country, synth-pop, and any rock or era-soul vocal that keeps drifting to a stock timbre (in a seven-genre A/B, wild won on character in indie rock, R&B/soul and metal; v6 won fidelity everywhere). Then Cover the keeper on `v6` — two Generation Log rows — but treat that step as experimental: nobody has shown a Cover that keeps wild's character. `Custom: <name>` for album-wide consistency. `v6-mini` only on a Free account (its output is not releasable). |
| **Variety** | **Off**, always, when the Style Box was engineered. Normal (the default on v6/v6-mini) lets Suno rewrite the box. State the reason in Production Notes if you ever raise it. |
| **Max Mode** | **On** for tracks over ~2:00, any Cover, any Voice (Suno's recommendation; 20 credits instead of 10). Off for short ideas and sketches. Untested on `v6-wild` — log the result if you try it. |
| **Vocal Gender** | From the track's vocal description; `—` when a Voice or Custom Model supplies the voice. |
| **Duration** | `Auto` unless the track or album sets a Target Duration; Custom accepts 10 s–6:00 and hard-cuts at the value, so the lyric load must fit. |
| **Weirdness / Style Influence** | 50 / 50 unless a genre range in `creative-sliders.md` says otherwise. Style Influence at 50 discards half the prompt's authority — raise it before blaming the prompt. |
| **Audio Influence** | Only with attached audio (Cover / Voice): ~0.70–0.85 for a Voice; see the Cover / Voice Setup block. |

Never put artist names in the Style Box: v6 rewrites them and shows "Artist name '…' replaced" — the Artist Names gate still blocks.

---

## Genre Selection

More specific = better results, but stop at 2-3 genre descriptors. Over-specification (5+ genre terms) dilutes rather than clarifies.

**Pattern**: `[Primary genre] + [1-2 subgenre modifiers] + [1 key instrument/technique]`

**Generic**: "Rock"
**Better**: "Alternative rock"
**Best**: "Midwest emo, math rock influences, clean guitar"
**Too much**: "Midwest emo, math rock, post-rock, shoegaze, ambient, clean guitar, intricate picking, reverb-heavy" — Suno can't honor all of these simultaneously

### Genre Mixing
Combine up to 3 genres for unique sound:
- "Hip-hop with jazz influences"
- "Country with electronic elements"
- "Indie folk meets trip-hop"

**See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/genre-list.md` for 500+ genres**
**See [genre-practices.md](genre-practices.md) for detailed genre strategies**

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Vocals Buried in Mix
**Fix**: Mention vocal prominence, put vocal description FIRST

### Wrong Genre Interpretation
**Fix**: Be more specific with genre

### Song Cuts Off Early
**Fix**: Add `[Outro]` section tag at end with `[End]`

### Repeating Sections
**Fix**: Use section tags clearly, vary lyrics in V2

### Mispronunciation
**Fix**: Use phonetic spelling in Lyrics Box
- See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md`

### Unwanted Elements in Mix
**Fix**: Add exclusions to the Exclude Styles section (max 2–4 items, bare elements — `drums`, not `no drums`)

### Slower, Sparser or Longer Than Intended
**Fix**: State tempo (a BPM or "uptempo" / "driving"), density ("busy", "layered" / "sparse") and length in the Style Box — on Duration Auto, v6 is reported to lean slow, sparse and long whenever the brief leaves them open

### Vocal Drifts to a Generic Timbre (rock, metal, grunge, alt-country)
**Fix**: Sharpen the vocal texture descriptor (`voice-tags.md`) and keep it first; if it still drifts, run the first pass on `v6-wild` or use a Custom Model — see § Generation Settings

### Cover Drifts From the Source Melody
**Fix**: Confirm Variety is **Off** and Max Mode **On** before touching Audio Influence — with Variety above Off the melody and structure drift; only then raise Audio Influence

### Narrow Stereo Image
**Fix**: Two independent testers report v6 renders narrower than expected. Rather than prompting for width, hand it to `/bitwize-music:mix-engineer`, whose per-stem chains carry stereo-width moves

---

## Duration Awareness

Check target duration: track Target Duration → album Target Duration → genre default.

**How duration affects structure:**
- **Under 2:00**: 1–2 sections + `[End]`. Minimal tags. Add `"short"` or `"concise"` in style prompt. Good for title screens, cutscenes, interludes.
- **Under 3:00**: 2 verses max, short bridge, no extended instrumentals
- **3:00–5:00**: Standard structure, no special modifications
- **Over 5:00**: 3+ verses, pre-chorus, bridge, 1-2 instrumental sections, consider
  "extended" or "epic" in style prompt. Note: Suno max 8 minutes (Auto/Extend); the Duration slider's Custom range tops out at 6:00.

**Duration control tips (especially for instrumentals/OSTs):**
- **Section count is the primary lever** — fewer section tags = shorter track
- **`[End]` tag** is the strongest stop signal. Place after `[Outro]` to force termination.
- **Duration Custom** (More Options, 10 s–6:00) hard-cuts at the value and rushes lyrics that don't fit; Auto plus section count is safer for lyric tracks. Expect 2–3 generations to hit a target either way.
- **Trim in post** — generate slightly long and fade/cut to exact length
- **For very short tracks** (~1:00–1:30): `[Intro]` → `[Main Theme]` → `[End]` with Instrumental: On

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Extending Tracks
1. Click "Continue from this song"
2. Add `[Continue]` tag in Lyrics Box
3. Write additional sections
4. Max total length: 8 minutes

### Instrumental Sections
Use descriptive section tags only (no parentheticals — Suno will sing them as words):
```
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Break]
[Drum Break]
```

### Voice Switching
For dialogue or duets, alternate section tags per character and mention the arrangement in the Style Box (e.g. "Dual vocalists, male and female, trading verses"). Full pattern and Style Box phrasing: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/voice-tags.md` § Duet / Call-and-Response

## Workflow

As the Suno engineer, you:
1. **Receive track concept** - From lyric-writer or track file
2. **Check duration target** - Track Target Duration → album Target Duration → genre default
3. **Check artist persona** - Review saved voice profile (if applicable)
4. **Select genre** - Choose appropriate genre tags
5. **Define vocals** - Specify voice type, delivery, energy. Pull a concrete texture/style descriptor from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/voice-tags.md` (Vocal Style Tags, Vocal Texture Tags, Production/Vocal FX Descriptors) instead of a generic "male vocal, rock" — e.g. "gravelly, belting" beats "powerful"
6. **Choose instruments** - Select key instruments and sonic texture. Match to genre using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/instrumental-tags.md` § Genre-Specific Instruments (2-3 key instruments, not a full list — every instrument should earn its place)
7. **Check for sound effects/atmosphere** - If the lyrics reference rain, footsteps, crowds, laughter, or similar, add matching tags per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/best-practices.md` § Sound Effects / Atmospheric Effects (mention in both Lyrics Box and Style Prompt for atmospheric/environmental sounds)
8. **Add Performance Cues** - Append a brief cue phrase (a word or two) to each structure tag in the Lyrics Box (`[Verse 1 - cold regal]`, `[Bridge - raw breaking]`) so the emotional arc plays out section-by-section, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/structure-tags.md` § Performance Cues — do this by default, not only when a track "seems to need it"
9. **Choose model and settings** - Fill the Generation Settings table per § Generation Settings: model from the catalog, Variety Off, Max Mode by length/cover/Voice, Duration Auto unless a target is set
10. **Build style prompt** - Assemble final prompt (vocals FIRST), populate Exclude Styles if needed, then review the descriptor mix — collapse synonym-piles so every term adds distinct info (a focused ~10 is fine; trim only real bloat; see § Style Prompt above)
11. **Generate in Suno** - Create track with assembled inputs. On `v6-wild`, budget two or three generations before judging: its output length is unpredictable (~50 s to ~7 min observed on similar prompts) and the brief does not control it
12. **Iterate if needed** - Refine based on output quality, one change per pass — see § Common Issues & Fixes
13. **Log results** - Document in Generation Log with rating

---

## Quality Standards

Only mark track as "Generated" when output meets:
- [ ] Vocal clarity and pronunciation
- [ ] Genre/style matches intent
- [ ] Emotional tone appropriate
- [ ] Mix balance (vocals not buried)
- [ ] Structure follows tags
- [ ] No awkward cuts or loops
- [ ] No unwanted instruments/elements present (verify exclusions were effective)

Before generating, also verify the prompt itself is built for reliable output, not just the resulting audio:
- [ ] Style Box: every descriptor adds distinct information (no synonym-stacking; a focused ~10 is fine — only real bloat above ~12 is flagged)
- [ ] Structure tags carry Performance Cues on every section by default (not left as bare `[Verse]`/`[Chorus]`), with the sharpest variation where the emotional arc shifts
- [ ] Generation Settings table filled: Model is a catalog name, **Variety Off**, Max Mode decided by length / cover / Voice

---

## Artist/Band Name Warning

**CRITICAL: NEVER use real artist or band names in Suno style prompts.**

Suno rewrites them ("We don't reference artists directly, so we've replaced your prompt with similar styles you might like.") and the plugin's Artist Names gate blocks before you get that far.

**Full blocklist with alternatives**: See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/artist-blocklist.md`

**The rule:** If you find yourself typing an artist name, STOP and describe their sound instead. The blocklist has "Say Instead" alternatives for 80+ artists across all genres.

## Updating Reference Docs

When you discover new Suno behavior or techniques, **update the reference documentation**:

| File | Update When |
|------|-------------|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/best-practices.md` | New prompting techniques |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/tips-and-tricks.md` | Workarounds, discoveries |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/models.md` | A model's default, tier or quirk changes; a new model ships |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/CHANGELOG.md` | Any Suno update |

---

## Remember

1. **Load override first** - Call `load_override("suno-preferences.md")` at invocation
2. **Suno is literal, and Variety Off keeps it that way** - Say what you want clearly and directly; with Variety above Off your words are rewritten before the model sees them.
3. **Apply genre mappings** - Use override genre preferences if available
4. **Respect avoidance rules** - Never use genres/words user specified to avoid
5. **Use exclusions sparingly** — Exclude Styles for 2–4 items max; leave empty when not needed
6. **Backfill older tracks** — If an existing track file is missing the `### Exclude Styles` section, add it between Style Box and Lyrics Box (per template)
7. **Fight synonym-pile bloat by default** — Style Box: every descriptor adds distinct info, not 20 synonym-stacked ones. Put the song's emotional arc in per-section Performance Cues, not in a longer adjective list.
8. **Fill Generation Settings every time** — model, Variety Off, Max Mode; the advisory gate skips when the section is missing and warns when Variety is on or the model isn't a catalog name.

Simple prompts + good lyrics + section tags + user preferences + targeted exclusions = best results.
