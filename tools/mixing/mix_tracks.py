Automated Mix Polish Pipeline for Suno Stems

Processes per-stem audio (vocals, backing_vocals, drums, bass, guitar,
keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, synth, other) with targeted
cleanup and EQ, then remixes into a polished stereo WAV ready for mastering.

Falls back to full-mix processing when stems are not available.

    Two detection modes:

    - std path (default, `peak_ratio=None`): flag samples where |diff| >
      threshold * std(diff). Backward-compatible with pre-#289 behavior.
    - windowed peak/rms path (`peak_ratio` set): flag 10 ms windows where
      peak/rms > peak_ratio, then locate the maximum-|sample| inside each
      flagged window. Semantics match `qc_tracks._check_clicks` so polish
      and QC speak the same language.

    Two repair modes:

    - "linear" (default): two-sample linear interpolation across the click
      index, same as pre-#289. Safer on dense full-mix content.
    - "cubic": fit a `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` through four clean
      samples (two on each side, `window_ms` away from the click) and
      overwrite the click region with the spline evaluated on the excised
      sample indices. For use on isolated stems where the spline can
      exploit the thin spectral content around the click.

    Args:
        data: Audio data (mono or stereo).
        rate: Sample rate in Hz.
        threshold: std-path detection multiplier. Ignored when `peak_ratio`
            is set. `threshold <= 0` is a passthrough (returns input).
        peak_ratio: Peak-to-RMS ratio over a 10 ms window above which the
            window is flagged as a click. When None the std path is used.
        repair: "linear" or "cubic". Cubic requires at least two clean
            samples ±`window_ms` away from the click; falls back to linear
            if neighbors are unavailable (near the start/end of the buffer).
        window_ms: Half-width of the cubic repair window, in milliseconds.
        detect_only: Count click sites without repairing any of them and
            return `data` unchanged. Used by the polish chain on stems
            whose `click_removal` is off, so the count is still reported
            (#553) without touching audio the user asked to leave alone.

    Returns:
        `(data, n_clicks)` where `n_clicks` is the number of click sites
        found (not windows flagged — coincident clicks in the same window
        count once). `data` is the repaired buffer, or the input
        unchanged when `detect_only` is set.

    and the full-mix fallback default to off because the detector cannot
    tell a synthetic consonant from a click — but a *genuine* click on

    `master_album`'s post-QC hard fail, after a whole mastering run. The
