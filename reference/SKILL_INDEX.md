## Common Skill Sequences

### New Album (Standard)
```
/new-album <name> <genre>
    -> /album-conceptualizer (plan concept, tracklist)
    -> /lyric-writer (for each track — auto-invokes /suno-engineer)
    -> /lyric-refiner (optional: multi-pass refinement for tightening + album cohesion)
    -> /pronunciation-specialist (scan for risks)
    -> /lyric-reviewer (final QC)
    -> /voice-checker (advisory: flag AI-sounding patterns)
    -> /pre-generation-check (validate all gates)
    -> [Generate in Suno]
    -> /mix-engineer (optional: polish raw audio)
    -> /mastering-engineer (master audio)
    -> /promo-director (optional: promo videos)
    -> /promo-writer (optional: generate social media copy)
    -> /release-director (release to platforms)
```

### True-Story/Documentary Album
```
/new-album <name> <genre>
    -> /researcher (coordinate research)
        -> /document-hunter (find court docs)
        -> /researchers-legal, /researchers-gov, etc. (specialized research)
        -> /researchers-verifier (verify citations)
    -> /verify-sources (human source verification)
    -> /lyric-writer (write lyrics from sources — auto-invokes /suno-engineer)
    -> /lyric-refiner (optional: multi-pass refinement for tightening + album cohesion)
    -> /pronunciation-specialist (names, places, acronyms)
    -> /lyric-reviewer (verify against sources)
    -> /pre-generation-check (validate all gates)
    -> [Generate in Suno] -> /mix-engineer (optional) -> /mastering-engineer -> /release-director
```

### OST / Mixed Album (Vocal + Instrumental)
```
/new-album <name> <genre>
    -> /album-conceptualizer (plan world, leitmotifs, scene mapping, mark tracks as vocal/instrumental)
    -> For each track:
        VOCAL TRACK:
            -> /lyric-writer (auto-invokes /suno-engineer)
            -> /pronunciation-specialist
            -> /lyric-reviewer
        INSTRUMENTAL TRACK (instrumental: true in frontmatter):
            -> /suno-engineer directly (Style Box + section tags only, no lyrics)
    -> /pre-generation-check (validates all gates — auto-skips lyrics gates for instrumental tracks)
    -> [Generate in Suno — instrumental tracks use Instrumental: On]
    -> /mix-engineer (optional: polish raw audio)
    -> /mastering-engineer (master audio)
    -> /album-art-director (world-themed artwork)
    -> /promo-director (optional: promo videos)
    -> /release-director (release to platforms)
```

**Note**: Any album type can have instrumental tracks — OST is just the most common case.
Mark a track as instrumental by setting `instrumental: true` in track frontmatter.
Instrumental tracks skip: lyric-writer, pronunciation-specialist, lyric-reviewer.
Pre-generation-check auto-skips Gates 2 (Lyrics), 3 (Pronunciation), 4 (Explicit) for instrumentals.

### Resume Existing Work
```
/resume <album-name>
    -> [Claude reports status and next steps]
    -> Continue from appropriate skill based on phase
```

### Quick Quality Check
```
/pronunciation-specialist <track>
    -> /lyric-reviewer <track>
    -> /voice-checker <track> (advisory)
    -> /explicit-checker <album>
    -> /validate-album <album>
```

### Track Regeneration (Rejected Generation)
```
[Listen to generated track — not happy?]
    -> Log rejection reason in Generation Log
    -> IF style issue:
        -> /suno-engineer (revise Style Box)
        -> [Regenerate on Suno]
    -> IF lyrics issue:
        -> /lyric-writer (fix lyrics)
        -> /pronunciation-specialist (re-check)
        -> [Regenerate on Suno]
    -> IF bad luck (right prompt, wrong result):
        -> [Regenerate on Suno with same settings — Suno is non-deterministic]
    -> Log new attempt in Generation Log
    -> [Repeat until satisfied]
    -> Mark ✓ in Generation Log Rating
    -> Set Status: Final
```

### Post-Generation to Release
```
/mix-engineer <album> (optional: polish raw audio)
    -> /mastering-engineer <audio-folder>
    -> /promo-director <album> (optional)
    -> /promo-writer <album> (optional)
    -> /promo-reviewer <album> (optional)
    -> /cloud-uploader <album> (optional)
    -> /release-director <album>
```

## Skills That Work Together

Natural pairings that complement each other:

| Primary Skill | Pairs Well With | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| `/lyric-writer` | `/lyric-refiner` | Refine after writing, before QC |
| `/lyric-writer` | `/pronunciation-specialist` | Catch pronunciation issues immediately |
| `/pronunciation-specialist` | `/lyric-reviewer` | Reviewer verifies pronunciation fixes applied correctly |
| `/lyric-reviewer` | `/voice-checker` | Reviewer catches craft issues, voice-checker catches authenticity issues |
| `/lyric-reviewer` | `/pre-generation-check` | Review must pass before generation gate |
| `/researcher` | `/document-hunter` | Automate document acquisition |
| `/suno-engineer` | `/clipboard` | Copy prompts directly to Suno |
| `/mix-engineer` | `/mastering-engineer` | Polish audio before mastering for best results |
| `/mastering-engineer` | `/promo-director` | Promo videos need mastered audio |
| `/promo-director` | `/cloud-uploader` | Upload videos for sharing |
| `/promo-writer` | `/promo-reviewer` | Generate copy, then polish it |
| `/promo-writer` | `/voice-checker` | Flag AI tells in promo copy before review |
| `/promo-writer` | `/promo-director` | Social copy + promo videos for full campaign |
| `/promo-reviewer` | `/release-director` | Polish copy before release |
| `/album-conceptualizer` | `/album-art-director` | Visual and sonic vision together |
| `/new-album` | `/album-conceptualizer` | Always plan after creating structure |
| `/lyric-reviewer` | `/explicit-checker` | Both are pre-generation QC |

---

## Skills to Avoid Combining

Redundant or conflicting combinations:

| Avoid Combining | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|
| `/lyric-writer` + `/lyric-reviewer` (simultaneously) | Run separately: writer first, reviewer after pronunciation pass |
| `/lyric-writer` + `/lyric-refiner` (simultaneously) | Run refiner after writer completes — refiner is a post-writing tool |
| Multiple researcher specialists at once | Use `/researcher` to coordinate them instead |
| `/mastering-engineer` before audio import | Need to generate on Suno and import audio first |
| `/release-director` before `/mastering-engineer` | Audio must be mastered before release |
| `/promo-director` before mastering | Promo videos need final mastered audio |

## Quick Tips

- **Lost?** Start with `/resume <album-name>` to see status and next steps
- **New here?** Run `/tutorial` for guided walkthrough
- **Building true-story album?** Always start with `/researcher` before writing
- **Before Suno?** Run `/lyric-reviewer` to catch issues
- **Weird pronunciations?** Run `/pronunciation-specialist` on every track
- **Track sounds wrong?** Log the reason in Generation Log, fix prompt or lyrics, regenerate. See Regeneration Workflow
- **Instrumental track?** Set `instrumental: true` in frontmatter, then use `/suno-engineer` directly (skips lyrics workflow)
- **Not sure what's available?** Run `/help` for categorized skill list
