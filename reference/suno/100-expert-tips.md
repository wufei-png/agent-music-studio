# Suno AI Music Creation — 100 Words of Advice

A compilation of community craft advice for working in Suno, distilled into 100 tips, tricks, workflows, blueprints, and templates. For fun or for profit. Contributed by [@cbrahms](https://github.com/cbrahms) ([#561](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/pull/561)).

Companion to [best-practices.md](best-practices.md) (the how), [models.md](models.md) (which model, which settings) and [tips-and-tricks.md](tips-and-tricks.md) (the troubleshooting). This doc is the *why* and the *craft*. Where a tip here differs from those three, they win: they are kept against Suno's own documentation. Tips phrased as "reported" are craft opinions from the community, not tested behaviour.

---

## I. Mindset & Workflow (1–10)

**1. Suno is a session musician, not a vending machine.** Brief it the way you'd brief a player: genre, feel, tempo, reference era, what to leave out. Vague briefs get generic takes.

**2. Generate in batches of 4–6, never 1.** Suno is non-deterministic. One generation tells you nothing about the prompt. Five tell you whether the prompt or the dice are the problem.

**3. Keep a prompt journal.** A plain text file with date, Style Box, sliders, and a one-line verdict. Every keeper prompt becomes a reusable template. Every failure becomes a lesson you don't repeat.

**4. Decide the song's job before you type.** Background for a video? Club banger? Lullaby? The job dictates length, dynamics, vocal density, and how much ear-candy you need.

**5. Write the hook first.** If you can't hum the chorus after writing it, Suno won't make it memorable either. The model amplifies what's there; it doesn't invent a hook you didn't write.

**6. Change one variable per iteration.** Style Box OR lyrics OR sliders. Change all three and you learn nothing from the result.

**7. Listen on three systems before you keep anything.** Phone speaker, earbuds, monitors or car. Suno mixes can sound huge on headphones and hollow on a phone.

**8. Name your files like a producer.** `songslug_v03_takeB_vocal-warm.mp3` beats `Untitled (14).mp3` when you're picking a keeper two weeks later.

**9. Set a kill limit.** If a concept isn't landing after 12–15 generations, the concept is wrong, not the luck. Rewrite the brief or bench the song.

**10. Finish songs.** A hundred 80-percent drafts teach less than ten released tracks. Shipping exposes what actually mattered.

---

## II. The Style Box — Prompt Craft (11–22)

**11. Lead with genre, then vocal, then mood, then production.** Suno weights early words more heavily. `Dark synthwave, female alto vocal, melancholic, analog warmth, 100 BPM` reads in the right priority order.

**12. Two or three genres max.** `Country trap jazz fusion` is a coin flip. Pick a primary genre and one modifier: `Country, trap-influenced drums`.

**13. Describe the sound, not the artist.** Named artists are rewritten automatically — Suno shows "Artist name '…' replaced" and your intent goes with the name. See [artist-blocklist.md](artist-blocklist.md). Say what they *sound like* instead (tips 47–48).

**14. Use production language.** `Tape saturation, wide stereo, dry vocal, punchy compressed drums` moves the needle more than `good quality, professional`.

**15. Specify tempo as a number.** `128 BPM` is unambiguous. `Fast` means something different in doom metal and drum and bass.

**16. Era anchors beat adjectives.** `1994 boom bap` or `late-70s AOR` conjures instrumentation, mix style, and vocal delivery in one stroke.

**17. Name the instruments you want to hear.** Suno defaults to genre clichés. `Fretless bass, Rhodes, brushed snare` steers away from them. See [instrumental-tags.md](instrumental-tags.md).

**18. Say what you don't want — in the Exclude Styles field.** Inline "no X" in the Style Box is ignored on v6; the dedicated field (Advanced Mode, Pro/Premier) is the only path. Two to four items — `autotune, EDM drops, rap verse` — cover the most common hijacks. See [best-practices.md § Negative Prompting](best-practices.md#negative-prompting).

**19. Every descriptor has to earn its place.** The field takes 1,000 characters, and focused boxes of around ten descriptors work well — what dilutes is synonym piles, not length. If you need a paragraph, you're probably describing two songs. See [best-practices.md § Keep It Simple](best-practices.md#keep-it-simple--avoid-prompt-fatigue).

**20. Punctuation is structure.** Commas separate descriptors; periods separate blocks (`[Vocal]. [Genre]. [Production]`). Semicolons, slashes and quotes are reported to parse inconsistently — nothing is lost by avoiding them.

**21. Keep a "house sound" suffix.** Ten to fifteen words you append to every prompt for a project: `warm analog mix, slight vinyl crackle, intimate vocal, no reverb wash`. This is how albums sound like albums.

**22. Test prompts as instrumentals first.** Toggle instrumental on. If the bed sounds right without vocals, you've validated the Style Box independently of lyric problems.

---

## III. Lyrics & Structure (23–36)

**23. Every section gets a structure tag.** `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`. Untagged blocks get treated as verses. See [structure-tags.md](structure-tags.md).

**24. Chorus in the first 45 seconds.** Streaming skips happen before the minute mark. Intro of four bars, one short verse, chorus. Save the long intro for the album cut.

**25. Write to a syllable budget.** Roughly 8–12 syllables per line for mid-tempo pop, 12–16 for rap, 6–8 for ballads. Overstuffed lines get rushed or dropped.

**26. Make every verse different.** Twin verses (same shape, same images) are the number one sign of AI-written lyrics. Verse two should advance time, perspective, or stakes.

**27. Repeat the chorus verbatim.** Suno sings the exact text. Small variations between choruses are reported to come back as different melodies, and the song loses its anchor.

**28. Use parentheses for backing vocals.** `Take me home (take me home)` produces a call-and-response layer. Overuse it and everything becomes a gang chant.

**29. Ellipses and line breaks control phrasing.** A line break is a breath. `...` is a held note or pause. Commas mid-line barely register.

**30. Stack short lines for urgency, long lines for reflection.** Line length shapes melody. Four-word lines feel punchy. Fourteen-word lines meander.

**31. End sections on strong stressed syllables.** Lines ending on `the`, `of`, `and` get swallowed. End on nouns and verbs.

**32. Put the title in the chorus at least twice.** Listeners remember what to search for. So does the algorithm.

**33. A bridge is a change of key, view, or truth.** If the bridge just says the chorus with different words, cut it and go to a final chorus with a lift.

**34. `[Instrumental Break]` beats `[Solo]`.** `[Solo]` often produces noodling. Name the instrument: `[Guitar Solo]`, `[Saxophone Break]`.

**35. Control the ending.** `[Outro]` plus `[Fade Out]` or `[End]` on the final line. Without it, Suno rambles or cuts mid-phrase.

**36. Read the lyrics aloud with a metronome.** If you stumble, Suno stumbles. Fix the prosody on paper before spending credits.

---

## IV. Vocals & Pronunciation (37–46)

**37. One vocal descriptor cluster, placed early.** `Breathy female mezzo, close-mic, slight rasp` in the Style Box. Piling on six adjectives produces mush. See [voice-tags.md](voice-tags.md).

**38. Age and grit need reinforcement.** `Mature` alone reads young. Combine `weathered, gravel, lived-in, 50s male baritone` and, if needed, escalate to inline metatags in the lyrics.

**39. Suno cannot read context for homographs.** `Live`, `read`, `wind`, `tear`, `bass`, `lead`. Respell phonetically in the Suno lyrics only: `wynd` for the noun, `reed` for the present tense. See [pronunciation-guide.md](pronunciation-guide.md).

**40. Spell brand names and acronyms as sounds.** `A.P.I.` becomes `ay pee eye`. `Kubernetes` becomes `koo-ber-NET-eez`. Keep clean spellings in your published lyric sheet.

**41. Hyphenate for syllables.** `Deb-Ian`, `lo-ove` — hyphens guide syllable count and sustained vowels; capitalising one syllable to force stress (`re-COR-ded`) is reported to work. Use sparingly; it's a scalpel. See [pronunciation-guide.md](pronunciation-guide.md).

**42. All caps means shouted — usually.** Suno tends to read capitalization as intensity, but it is unpredictable; test on a short generation. Use it for one line, not a verse.

**43. Duets need explicit handoffs.** Alternate section tags per character (`[Verse - Character A]` / `[Verse - Character B]`) and say it in the Style Box too: `Dual vocalists, male and female, trading verses`. Without both you get one singer. See [voice-tags.md § Duet](voice-tags.md#duet--call-and-response).

**44. Whisper and spoken tags work when paired with dynamics.** `[Whispered, intimate]` at the start of a verse, then `[Full voice]` at the pre-chorus. Contrast is what sells it.

**45. If the vocal disappears, the intro is too long.** Cut `[Intro]` instrumentation descriptors or add `[Vocals enter immediately]` as the first line.

**46. Ad-libs go in brackets at line end.** `Running out of time [yeah]`. Keep them to the second half of the song where energy peaks.

---

## V. Distilling an Artist's Sound (47–54)

**47. Reverse-engineer in five dimensions.** Instrumentation, vocal character, rhythm feel, production era, lyrical stance. Fill all five and you have a description that beats a name.

**48. Sound Blueprint template:**
```
[genre] + [subgenre modifier], [vocal: gender, range, texture, delivery],
[rhythm: tempo, feel, drum sound], [key instruments x3],
[production: era, mix width, effects], [mood: 2 words]
```
Example: `Indie folk, chamber-pop touches, soft male tenor with cracked falsetto, 78 BPM brushed kit, nylon guitar, upright piano, string quartet, 2008 lo-fi warmth, wide reverb, wistful and tender`.

**49. Borrow the drums, not the melody.** Rhythm section descriptions carry the most identity with the least legal and ethical baggage.

**50. Describe the room.** `Recorded in a wooden church`, `dead vocal booth`, `stadium echo`. Space is half of what makes a sound recognizable.

**51. Use the reference era's gear.** `Juno-106 pads, LinnDrum, gated reverb` says 1984 without saying a name.

**52. Vocal texture words are your strongest lever.** Nasal, chesty, airy, smoky, glassy, throaty, sibilant, boyish, matronly. Pick two.

**53. Save a Voice from your best take, then iterate around it.** A Voice (Suno's current name for a Persona) locks vocal identity across an album. Generate the definitive vocal first, save it, then write the other songs to it with Max Mode On. See [tips-and-tricks.md § Voices](tips-and-tricks.md#voices-for-vocal-consistency).

**54. Blend two blueprints for something new.** Take the rhythm block from one and the vocal block from another. That's where original sounds live and where you stop chasing imitation.

---

## VI. Sliders, Voices, Covers & the Editor (55–66)

**55. Style Influence up, Weirdness down for commercial work.** Start at the defaults (50/50) and raise Style Influence before blaming the prompt; a 70/20 split is a common commercial setting. Push Weirdness up only when the results are boring, not when they're wrong. Genre starting ranges: [creative-sliders.md](creative-sliders.md#recommended-starting-ranges-by-genre).

**56. Weirdness above 60 is an experimental tool.** Expect tempo shifts, odd instrumentation, and structure drift. Great for noise and ambient. Terrible for a wedding song. See [creative-sliders.md](creative-sliders.md).

**57. Set Audio Influence by what the upload is for.** Low (0.00–0.40) treats it as a loose seed, mid (0.40–0.65) balances it against the prompt, high (0.65–1.00) hews to its melody and arrangement — the safe zone for faithful covers, and ~0.70–0.85 for a Voice. See [creative-sliders.md § Audio Influence](creative-sliders.md#audio-influence).

**58. Upload a hummed melody, not a full demo.** A clean vocal or a single instrument gives the model a spine without confusing it with your bad mix.

**59. Cover mode is a re-arrangement tool.** Generate the song once, then cover it into three genres with Variety Off and Max Mode On so the melody holds. The one that surprises you is often the release.

**60. Extend from a specific timestamp, not the end.** Trim the tail to the last good bar, then extend. You avoid building on a weak ending.

**61. Crop before extend, extend before replace.** Get the skeleton right, then use Replace Section to surgically fix a bad line or a flubbed word — one change per edit, with a list of what must survive it ([tips-and-tricks.md § Replace Section](tips-and-tricks.md#replace-section-feature-propremier)).

**62. Replace Section with identical lyrics to fix pronunciation.** Keep the text, only respell the problem word. The surrounding audio stays intact.

**63. A Voice is only as good as the take you save it from.** It is captured from one song, so pick the keeper whose vocal you would happily hear across the album, test it on a short generation, and upgrade older Voices with "Upgrade Voice to v6" before an album run.

**64. Seed ideas with short generations.** A 30-second instrumental test costs less and tells you whether the palette is right before you commit to full lyrics.

**65. Regenerate the section, not the song.** When 90 percent is right, an edit preserves the take you already love instead of rolling the dice again. Listen to the seam: launch-week reports say Studio's regenerate-section can garble vocals.

**66. Save keepers to a workspace immediately.** Liked tracks get buried under new generations within a day. See [workspace-management.md](workspace-management.md).

---

## VII. Spoken Word, Poetry & Experimental Noise (67–78)

**67. Tag spoken word explicitly.** `[Spoken word]` at the section head and `spoken word, no singing, poetry reading` in the Style Box. Otherwise the model tries to sing your poem.

**68. Give spoken word a bed.** `Sparse ambient piano, field recordings, distant traffic` keeps it from feeling like a phone memo.

**69. Punctuation is the performance.** Periods stop. Line breaks breathe. Em-dashes hold. Write the delivery into the layout.

**70. Keep spoken lines under ten words.** Long sentences get rushed. Break thoughts across lines like a poem, not a paragraph.

**71. Mix one sung refrain into a spoken piece.** A four-line sung chorus between spoken verses gives listeners an anchor and makes the piece playlist-friendly.

**72. For noise, describe textures and processes.** `Granular synthesis, feedback loops, contact mic on metal, bit-crushed, tape stop`. Genre names for noise are too broad.

**73. Push Weirdness to 80+ and Style Influence to 30 for noise.** You want the model off-balance. Low style adherence lets textures collide.

**74. Use sound-word lyrics for rhythmic noise.** Onomatopoeia like `tk tk tsss`, `brrrap`, `hush hush` produces percussive vocal textures the model treats as instruments.

**75. Structure tags still work in noise pieces.** `[Build]`, `[Collapse]`, `[Drone]`, `[Silence]`, `[Rupture]`. Custom tags in brackets steer dynamics even outside song form.

**76. Generate short, then stitch.** Noise and ambient benefit from generating 30–60 second cells and assembling them in a DAW. You get control the model won't give you.

**77. Field recordings via Audio Influence.** Upload rain, a train, a crowd. Set influence around 40. The model builds harmonic material on top of real-world texture.

**78. ASMR, meditation, and sleep tracks are a real market.** `Whispered, ASMR, no music, soft background hum, slow` with lyrics that are gentle instructions. Long-form, low competition, steady streams.

---

## VIII. Post-Production & Mastering (79–86)

**79. Suno output is not mastered.** It already comes in loud — around -9 to -7 LUFS on pop and EDM, -12 to -11 on lo-fi — which is not the same as finished. Master to -14 LUFS / -1.0 dBTP for streaming. See [best-practices.md § Suno Output Loudness](best-practices.md#suno-output-loudness-pre-mastering).

**80. Download WAV, not MP3.** Master from the highest quality source available. MP3 artifacts compound at every step.

**81. Stem-split before you polish.** Separate vocals, drums, bass, and other, then make balance moves — level, pan, broad tone — per stem. Suno stems are synthesized and bleed into each other, so they suit balance, not surgery. See `/bitwize-music:mix-engineer`.

**82. High-pass everything except bass and kick.** Low-end build-up on pads and vocals is common; the plugin's polish presets apply a per-stem high-pass for exactly this, with the bass stem kept low (20–35 Hz) to protect the sub.

**83. Tame the 2–5 kHz sizzle on vocals — gently.** Suno vocals can fatigue at volume, but surgical moves on a synthesized stem eat consonants; a broad, shallow cut is the ceiling. Let the mix-engineer analysis tell you whether the harshness is really there before you touch it.

**84. Check mono compatibility.** Wide Suno stereo can cancel on phone speakers. Fold to mono and confirm the vocal and kick survive.

**85. Target -14 LUFS / -1.0 dBTP for streaming.** Genre informs the rest: rock and pop sit around -12 to -14, EDM and hip-hop -8 to -12, classical and jazz -16 to -18. Different destinations, different masters; don't upload the club master to Spotify. See `/bitwize-music:mastering-engineer`.

**86. Master the album as a set.** Match tonal balance and loudness across tracks so the listener isn't reaching for the volume knob. Reference-track matching to your best song works well.

---

## IX. The AI Music Video Process (87–94)

**87. Step 1: Lock the audio first.** Never storyboard to a draft. Video timing, lyric sync, and cuts all depend on the final master.

**88. Step 2: Write a shot list from the lyrics.** One visual idea per section. Verse one: a room. Chorus: the open road. Bridge: close-up hands. This is your prompt map for the image and video models.

**89. Step 3: Build a visual bible.** Three to five reference images, a color palette, a lens choice, a time of day. Every image prompt inherits this block, the same way a Style Box suffix keeps an album coherent.

**90. Step 4: Generate stills before motion.** Image models are cheaper and faster. Approve the look in stills, then animate only the winners with an image-to-video model.

**91. Step 5: Cut on the beat, but not every beat.** Cut on the downbeat of each new section and on chorus entrances. Cutting every bar reads as a slideshow.

**92. Step 6: Sync lyrics with a transcript.** Run the master through a transcription tool to get word timestamps, then place lyric overlays or lip-synced characters against them.

**93. Step 7: Motion loops for budget videos.** Four to six looping 5-second clips, alternated and speed-ramped, carry a three-minute song convincingly. Save the expensive generations for the chorus.

**94. Step 8: Export vertical and horizontal.** 9:16 for Shorts, Reels, TikTok. 16:9 for YouTube. Frame the visual bible with both crops in mind from step 3.

---

## X. Rights, Release & Profit (95–100)

**95. Know your plan's license.** Free-tier output is personal and non-commercial (7 lifetime trial downloads). On Pro and Premier, commercial use requires a permitted download on the paid plan — Pro 20 and Premier 60 a month, stems included — and Remixes of other people's songs are never commercial. Never remove the in-audio watermark. The Terms changed on 2026-09-03 and will again; see [best-practices.md § Ownership](best-practices.md#ownership-rights--downloads-terms-effective-september-3-2026).

**96. Register your songs.** Writers of lyrics and arrangement decisions have a claim. Register with a PRO and use a distributor that accepts AI-assisted work and disclose per their policy.

**97. Disclose honestly.** Platforms and listeners are increasingly hostile to hidden AI. Owning it in your bio builds an audience; getting caught loses one.

**98. Build catalogs, not singles.** Ambient, lo-fi, sleep, focus, and workout playlists reward volume and consistency. Twenty coherent tracks under one project name beat one great song.

**99. Sync and stock are the quiet money.** Instrumental beds for creators, podcasts, and ads. Deliver stems, multiple lengths (15s, 30s, 60s, full), and clean loop points.

**100. Your taste is the product.** Anyone can prompt. What sells is knowing which of the six generations is the one, and why. Spend as much time listening critically as you spend generating.

## v6 Addendum (launched September 9, 2026)

Suno shipped the v6 family the day before this doc was first written and retired every earlier model the same day, so nothing above runs on anything but v6. What is settled, from Suno's own documentation and the first two weeks of hands-on reports (full catalog: [models.md](models.md)):

- **Three models, pick on purpose.** `v6` is the precise flagship (Pro/Premier) and the default for finished tracks. `v6-wild` is deliberately less predictable, for exploration and for genres where v6 plays it safe — draft in wild, then Cover the keeper on v6. `v6-mini` is the faster, lighter model on every plan and the only one on Free; Free output is non-commercial.
- **Variety is not a diversity knob.** At any setting above Off it rewrites and expands your Style Box. If you engineered the box, set Variety **Off** (v6 and v6-mini default to Normal; wild defaults to Off). Tip 2's batches come from generating again, not from Variety.
- **Max Mode** doubles the credit cost (20 per generation) for consistency across the song; Suno recommends it over two minutes, on Covers, and with Voices.
- **Advanced Mode is where the controls are**: Vocal Gender, Duration (Auto or Custom 10 s–6:00), Weirdness and Style Influence (both default 50), Exclude Styles. Suno's plain-language edits, single-lyric swaps, mashups and image / video / voice-memo inputs live in **Simple Mode**, which treats typed lyrics as a seed — so tips 61–62 still stand for engineered lyrics.
- **Personas are now Voices.** Same feature, new name, with a one-click "Upgrade Voice to v6" on older ones. Custom Models were upgraded automatically. Tips 53 and 63 are written for the new name.
- **Older songs**: Remaster when you only want better audio, Cover when you want v6 to reinterpret it following the melody — both render on v6.
- **Craft advice carried over unchanged**: focused Style Box, concrete instrument names over adjectives, tempo as a number, one variable per iteration, and the Exclude Styles field rather than inline "no X". One report says the word `Duet` must appear in the Style Box for two-voice tracks — the pattern in tip 43 works without it.

Model-specific quirks (genre-dependent quality, stereo width, wild's unpredictable length) are tracked in [models.md](models.md) and `CHANGELOG.md`; revisit this section when they move.
