# Suno Creative Sliders Reference

Deep-dive guide to Suno's Creative Sliders — **Weirdness**, **Style Influence**, **Audio Influence**, and **Variety** with its **Personalize** toggle — including per-slider behavior, genre starting points, interaction effects, and when to reach for a slider vs. rewrite the style prompt. **Max Mode** is a toggle, not a slider, and is covered at the end.

## What the Sliders Do

The sliders live under More Options in Advanced Mode and sit *on top of* your style prompt. They don't change **what** Suno makes — the prompt does that. They change **how hard Suno commits to the prompt** and **how far it's allowed to wander**.

- **Weirdness** — how experimental vs. predictable the result is.
- **Style Influence** — how tightly the output hugs your style prompt.
- **Audio Influence** — how much a piece of uploaded reference audio shapes the output (only appears when you provide reference audio).

Throughout this guide, slider positions are given on a **0.00–1.00 scale** — the same range the API exposes for `styleWeight` and `weirdnessConstraint` (see the [README API table](README.md#api-parameters)). If your interface shows a 0–100 scale instead, read `0.70` as `70`. **These bands are starting-point recommendations from this guide, not Suno-official defaults** — start at the defaults, generate once, then dial them in by ear.

## Weirdness

Controls how experimental and unexpected Suno's choices are — melody, harmony, arrangement quirks, structural surprises.

| Position | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Low** (`0.00–0.30`) | Predictable, hooky, familiar. Strong, singable choices; conventional song shapes. The safe zone for radio-style results. |
| **Mid** (`0.30–0.55`) | Balanced. Mostly conventional with occasional pleasant surprises. |
| **High** (`0.55–1.00`) | Experimental and unexpected. Odd chord moves, unusual textures, less predictable structure. Rewarding for exploration, but drift and misfires increase. |

**Raise it** when the output is too safe or generic and you want the AI to surprise you. **Lower it** when you need a dependable hook and clean, conventional structure.

**Note**: High Weirdness increases variance between generations — expect to generate more takes and cherry-pick.

---

## Style Influence

Controls how tightly the output adheres to your style prompt — genre hallmarks, named instruments, mood words.

| Position | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Low** (`0.00–0.40`) | Loose. Suno treats the prompt as a suggestion, blends influences freely, fills gaps its own way. Good for fusions and happy accidents. |
| **Mid** (`0.40–0.60`) | Balanced adherence. Honors the prompt while leaving room to breathe. |
| **High** (`0.60–1.00`) | Tight. Strong genre purity; the prompt's tags are enforced hard. Best when the genre must be unmistakable. |

**Raise it** for genre purity — when the result is drifting off-genre or ignoring your tags. **Lower it** when you want the AI to surprise you, blend styles, or when a dominant Voice is over-processing the mix (per [tips-and-tricks.md](tips-and-tricks.md#voices-for-vocal-consistency), lowering Style Influence can rebalance an overpowering Voice).

**Caution**: Very high Style Influence on a thin or contradictory prompt can produce a rigid, wooden result — the engine is enforcing tags that fight each other. If that happens, fix the prompt before pushing the slider higher (see [Sliders vs. Style Prompt](#sliders-vs-style-prompt)).

---

## Audio Influence

Controls how much a piece of **uploaded reference audio** shapes the output. This slider **appears only when audio is uploaded** — via Cover, Upload Audio, Sample to Song, or **Voices**. With no reference audio, it isn't shown.

| Position | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Low** (`0.00–0.40`) | The upload is a loose seed. Your prompt and style lead; the reference just nudges. |
| **Mid** (`0.40–0.65`) | Balanced — the output carries the reference's character while following the prompt. |
| **High** (`0.65–1.00`) | The output hews closely to the uploaded audio's melody, feel, and arrangement. Safest for faithful covers and cross-track consistency. |

**Raise it** when a cover or reworked upload isn't resembling the source enough. **Lower it** when you want more transformation and less of the original bleeding through.

**With Voices (voice cloning):** keep Audio Influence **fairly high (~0.70–0.85)** so the result resembles the cloned voice — too low and Suno drifts toward a generic vocal. See [Voices & Custom Models](best-practices.md#voices-custom-models--my-taste). Suno's own tip in the Voices article is simply "have the Audio Influence slider up fairly high". Defaults are Weirdness 50 / Style Influence 50 / Audio Influence 25; "Reset sliders" restores them.

## Variety

Variety is not a "how weird" dial — it is a **prompt-rewriting** dial. Suno's FAQ: "The Variety slider is designed to introduce variety in your outputs by adjusting and updating your style prompts. If you'd like to retain full control of your style tags, reduce the Variety slider to 0." At any setting above Off, Suno expands your style text server-side, differently for each of the two takes; a tester with a style box reading only "R&B" at High got two different multi-line style prompts back.

| Stop | Suno's label | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Off** | "Exact style" — clips use the same style | Your Style Box is used verbatim. **The plugin's setting.** |
| **Normal** | "Balanced variety" — slight style variation | Default on v6, v6-mini and Custom Models |
| **High** | "Distinct styles" | Two clearly different reads of the prompt |
| **Extra** | "Bold exploration" | |
| **Max** | "Unreasonably varied" — clips may differ significantly from your style input | |

- **Default differs by model**: Normal on v6 / v6-mini / Custom, **Off on v6-wild**. Check it every session — the default reasserts when you switch models.
- **Personalize** ("Make Variety match your taste") sits next to it, off by default, and only acts when Variety is above Off. With Variety Off it is inert; leave it off.
- **A/B testing a prompt edit?** Variety Off, or take-to-take variance will swamp the effect of your change (HookGenius, day one).
- **Interaction with Style Influence**: Style Influence governs how hard Suno commits to the *prompt it has*; Variety changes *which prompt it has*. Set Variety first.
- **Covers**: with Variety above Off, a Cover of your own upload drifts in melody (reported; Max Mode is the other fix). Keep Variety Off on Covers.

## Max Mode

A toggle under More Options, not a slider. Suno's copy: "Uses more compute to maximize consistency throughout the song. Costs 2x credits per song." Recommended by Suno for songs longer than two minutes, covers that should stay close to the source, style transfer, and keeping vocals and style consistent through the track — which is why the plugin defaults it **On** for album tracks and for anything using a Voice. One creator reported two weak or broken outputs with Max Mode on during launch day (single source).

## Recommended Starting Ranges by Genre

Starting points only — generate, listen, then adjust. Weirdness and Style Influence are always available; Audio Influence applies only to upload/cover workflows. See [Genre-Specific Tips](best-practices.md#genre-specific-tips) for the matching prompt guidance.

| Genre category | Weirdness | Style Influence | Why |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Pop / radio pop | `0.10–0.30` | `0.60–0.80` | Familiar hooks and clean structure win; keep it on-genre. |
| Hip-Hop / Rap | `0.20–0.40` | `0.50–0.70` | Protect the pocket and flow; a little room for beat character. |
| Rock / Punk | `0.20–0.45` | `0.55–0.75` | Genre hallmarks matter; punk stays tight and fast. |
| Folk / Acoustic | `0.10–0.30` | `0.60–0.80` | Intimacy and coherence over surprise. |
| Electronic / EDM | `0.30–0.55` | `0.45–0.65` | Sound design rewards some experimentation. |
| K-Pop | `0.20–0.40` | `0.65–0.85` | Maximalist but genre-precise — switch-ups come from the prompt, not the slider. |
| Cinematic / Orchestral | `0.15–0.40` | `0.55–0.75` | Mood and coherence carry the piece. |
| Jazz / Improv | `0.40–0.65` | `0.40–0.60` | An improvisational feel benefits from deviation. |
| Ambient / Experimental / IDM | `0.55–0.85` | `0.25–0.50` | The unexpected is the point; loosen the leash. |
| Metal / Heavy | `0.10–0.30` | `0.65–0.85` | Suno struggles with heavy genres — lock hard on-genre and minimize deviation (see [Known Limitations](best-practices.md#known-limitations); consider a v6-wild first pass, then Cover on v6). |
| Documentary / narrative | `0.10–0.30` | `0.55–0.75` | The story carries the track — favor clear vocals and predictable structure so the lyric lands. |

## Interaction Effects

The two always-on sliders combine into four broad regions:

| | **Low Style Influence** | **High Style Influence** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Weirdness** | **Wild card** — maximum surprise, genre may dissolve. Great for idea-mining; expect drift and many regenerations. | **Adventurous within the lane** — unexpected choices that still read as the genre. The sweet spot for keeping a familiar genre fresh (pair with a specific genre tag). |
| **Low Weirdness** | **Loose & smooth** — Suno fills gaps its own way but stays tame. Good for gentle fusions. | **Safe & on-genre** — faithful, predictable, release-ready. The default for pop, folk, and narrative work; the risk is a generic result. |

**Key takeaways:**
- **High Weirdness + a specific genre tag** is the reliable "interesting but not chaotic" combo — the genre tag anchors the surprises.
- **Low Style Influence when you want the AI to surprise you** — it's the fastest lever for happy accidents.
- Push **both sliders to their extremes** only deliberately: high Weirdness + low Style Influence is a genuine wild card, not a fine-tuning move.

**Audio Influence interactions** (upload/cover flows):

- **High Audio Influence + Low Weirdness** — output tracks the reference closely. Safest for faithful covers and consistency.
- **High Audio Influence + High Weirdness** — a tug-of-war: the upload pulls toward the source while Weirdness pushes away. This can yield striking reinterpretations, but also incoherent or muddy results. Move one slider at a time and audition carefully.
- **High Audio Influence + High Style Influence** — two "adherence" pulls competing. If the reference audio and the style prompt describe *different* things, they fight — decide which is your source of truth and relax the other.

## Sliders vs. Style Prompt

The single most useful habit: diagnose whether a bad result is a **prompt problem** or a **slider problem** before you touch anything.

- The **style prompt** decides *what* the track is — genre, instruments, mood, tempo, vocal identity. A slider can't add a banjo, fix a mispronunciation, or change the tempo.
- The **sliders** decide *how strictly* Suno commits to that prompt and *how far* it may wander. They're fine-tuning, not a rescue for a vague or wrong prompt.

**Change the prompt when** the output has the wrong genre, wrong instruments, wrong mood or tempo, a missing element, or the vocal character is off. No slider fixes content. (Keep the prompt focused — every descriptor doing distinct work; a bloated synonym-pile won't be rescued by sliders either; see [Keep It Simple](best-practices.md#prompt-construction).)

**Adjust a slider when** the prompt is already right but the *interpretation* is off:

| Symptom | First move |
|---------|-----------|
| Output is generic / too safe | Raise Weirdness a little, **or** lower Style Influence a little (one at a time) |
| Output drifts off-genre / ignores tags | Raise Style Influence; if still off, sharpen the genre tag in the prompt |
| Output is chaotic / incoherent | Lower Weirdness; keep Style Influence mid–high |
| Result feels rigid / wooden | Lower Style Influence slightly, **or** simplify the prompt |
| Wrong instruments, mood, or tempo | Change the prompt — not a slider issue |
| Mispronunciation / wrong words | Fix lyrics + pronunciation — not a slider issue |
| Cover doesn't resemble the source | First confirm Variety is **Off** and Max Mode **On** — melody and structure drift with Variety on; then raise Audio Influence |
| Cover too close, want more transformation | Lower Audio Influence and/or raise Weirdness |

**Golden rule — change one thing at a time.** Adjusting a slider *and* rewriting the prompt in the same pass makes it impossible to know which move helped (this mirrors the "adjust one element at a time" advice in [Iteration Tips](best-practices.md#iteration-tips)).

---

## Quick Workflow

1. **Write a clear, focused prompt first** — genre + instruments + mood + vocal, every descriptor doing distinct work.
2. **Generate at the default slider positions.** Don't pre-adjust blind.
3. **Listen, then diagnose** — is this a prompt problem or a slider problem? (Use the table above.)
4. **If it's a slider problem, move ONE slider a small step** and regenerate.
5. **Log every attempt** — note the slider value and what changed, so you can reproduce the keeper.
